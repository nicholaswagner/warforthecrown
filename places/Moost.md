[[Dame Parthena Crabbe]]'s hamlet
Kind of a "bog". The Bog is to grow cranberries. Their primary export.

There is an extraordinary large coach house which serves as a tavern / inn.
Its the nicest Inn that we've seen by far.

The people are nicely dressed ( relatively speaking compared to stachys).

- coach house
- crabb estate
