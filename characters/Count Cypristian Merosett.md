### Count Cypristian Merosett

> “Engage in your machinations to your heart’s content, High Arcanist, but leave my family out of it. Next time you try to get your tentacles into the Merosett family, you will regret it.” - Count Cypristian Merosett


_Count Merosett pulls Rhenquist aside and explains the nature of his lack of magic to him. Once every few generations, the Merosetts give birth to an anchor, a child with no magic blood and who must never wield magic themselves. If Rhenquist learns magic, it will end the Merosett family’s sorcerous bloodline. Count Merosett expresses his sorrow that this misfortune has befallen Rhenquist, and explains that Rhenquist will have a life of absolute luxury, wanting for nothing, as long as he does the only thing the family will ever ask or expect of him - nothing at all._
