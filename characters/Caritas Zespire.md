#### Affluent and Carefree Playboy

 Lord Caritas of House Zespire is perceived as a charming and somewhat irresponsible nobleman. Known for his affable nature, he frequently mingles with the city's elite and maintains a prominent public profile. Often seen in the company of beautiful women, his reputation as a playboy is well-established. 
 
 Though he appears aloof and unconcerned with serious matters, Caritas is deeply passionate about three things: wine, women, and warring—specifically, dueling. 
 
 While others may assume he wastes his time in frivolous pursuits, Caritas has dedicated countless hours to mastering the blade.

#### Notable Inventory Items
- the folio of [[Museta Zespire]]
	- written by [[Museta Zespire]] , it is essentially a planner.  She took an active role in planning senatorial stuff.  schedules, seating charts.  discovers several spell scrolls tucked into the back.  "blur", "confetti cloud", "charital urge", "haste", and "marvelous mount"  ( I belive @TrashQueen has this, but will update later once confirmed)
