### Baron Nicolaus Okerra


- The Baron gives heartfelt condolences to [[Caritas Zespire]] for the loss of his father so many years ago, and admits that while he didn’t know the man personally, many of his colleagues have had many kind things to say about him. He shares his concerns about the vote to overturn primogeniture with Caritas - he is worried about the instability it would cause, especially because his young daughter Selli wants to become a knight, and he feels it’s his responsibility to give her as safe a world as possible. Caritas continues working to sway the Baron to Eutropia’s side.

#### Family
- Daughter:  "Selli"
- Wife: Deceased

#### Notes: 
- A stickler for tradition, "good man", sticks to the most traditional stances, concerned about upcoming vote, and "stability", not a fan of breaking with tradition
- Selly—daughter
- Selly wants to become a knight, and the Baron has reluctantly agreed to support her.
