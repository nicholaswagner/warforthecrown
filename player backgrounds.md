### Campaign Backgrounds 
_War for the Crown uses the following Uncommon campaign-specific backgrounds:_

---

#### Athletic Champion 
Your physique and skill brought you into the public eye, and a winning smile helps you stay there. The Glorian Empire honors its extraordinary athletes, celebrating them as cultural heroes. Whether you were a gladiator, a runner, a wrestler, or any other competitor, your most recent victory caused someone important to sit up and take notice. You may never have a political career in front of you, but for now your name is helping to bring a little extra money in, and maybe that's good enough. 

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost. You’re trained in the Athletics skill, and gain the Combat Climber skill feat. You’re also trained in The Glorian Empire Lore.

#### Child of Rosanna ==claimed==
You belong to a noble family that matters in The Glorian Empire, though as the story begins you may or may not be on good terms with your relatives. Your upbringing among the city's well-to-do gives you an upper hand when it comes to knowledge of high society, and you start the game being used to a certain level of comfort. With Princess Eutropia's efforts to provide for The Glorian Empire's common citizens and overturn years of tradition, new lines are being quietly drawn in the sand, and you have found yourself embroiled in these intrigues whether you intended to be or not. 

With this trait, the assumption is that you belong to a minor noble family (and can make up your family name). In this case, your family keeps a small manor in Aroden's View or Senate's Hill. If you want to be a member of one of Rosanna's major noble families, you must take the Noble Scion heritage. 

  
Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost. You’re trained in the Society skill, and gain the Courtly Graces skill feat. You’re also trained in Fashion Lore.

#### (Claimed) Disgraced Noble ==claimed==

Your noble family used to matter, until your father took a stand against Maxillar Pythareus, the commander of The Glorian Empire's military. True or not, the accusations Pythareus leveled against your family in return destroyed your reputation and isolated you from the society you grew up in. Now the only thing that matters to you is clawing your way back up the social ladder, either for your own quality of life or to clear your family's name. You've had to practice deception as you began working your way back into Glorian social circles. 

  

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost. You’re trained in the Deception skill, and gain the Charming Liar skill feat. You’re also trained in Nobility Lore.

#### Rising Star 

All too often, great minds must suffer for their art, but you're one of the lucky ones. Your skills attracted the attention of a noble patron who pays for your food, housing, and tools. As your patron introduces you to other cultural elites, you're slowly learning to navigate the treacherous waters of high society, but you still remember the lean times when each meal was a hard-won treasure. 

  

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost. You’re trained in the Performance skill, and gain the Fascinating Performance skill feat. You’re also trained in Arts Lore.

#### Senatorial Hopeful 

While you belong to a noble family, hailing from the outlying prefectures means you lack the pull and wealth needed to rub shoulders with the stars of Rosanna's social scene. Your life has been quiet, isolated from the thrum of fashion and pop culture, but you see this as a source of insight and aim to help people by someday joining the senate. It'll be a long journey, but you've already begun learning which hands to shake and how to listen carefully when others tell you what they want. 

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost. You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill, and gain the Group Impression skill feat. You’re also trained in Nobility Lore.

#### Glorian Patriot

Claimed by [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]
You love your country, its history, and its people... even though they may not love you back. Whether you're a bureaucrat, a minor noble, or a soldier, you want your community to be the best it can be and you channel that love into a position in service to the people of The Glorian Empire. 

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost. You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill, and gain the Hobnobber skill feat. You’re also trained in History Lore. 



#### Young Reformer
Claimed by [[Caritas Zespire]]
Perhaps you were born at the bottom of Glorian society and you're tired of seeing your friends and family toil endlessly with no hope of a better life, or maybe your privileged outlook was shattered by empathy or tragedy. Either way, you know the system is broken, and you've dedicated your life to fixing it. But tradition rules The Glorian Empire as much as any Grand Prince, and change requires more influence than you have... so far. You've got a few friends and allies, and plenty of determination, but while you work toward the power you need to change the nation, you'll have to resort to more discrete ways of righting wrongs and curbing the abuses of the upper class. 

Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost. You’re trained in the Thievery skill, and gain the Subtle Theft skill feat. You’re also trained in The Glorian Empire Lore.
