A suit of chain mail consists of several pieces of armor composed of small metal rings linked together in a protective mesh. It typically includes a chain shirt, leggings, a pair of arms, and a coif, collectively protecting most of the body.

#### Traits

**Flexible:**

The armor is pliable and doesn’t hinder most actions. You don’t apply its check penalty to Acrobatics or Athletics checks.

**Noisy:**

This armor is loud and likely to alert others to your presence. The armor’s check penalty applies to Stealth checks even if you have the required Strength modifier.
