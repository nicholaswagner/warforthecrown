### Dignity's Barb

[[Arturo Basri]]'s Light Crossbow.  Found in the labyrinth beneath the senate on the night of the massacre.

Brass inlay and Glorian military symbols adorn fine wooden stock of this masterwork darkwood light crossbow. The polished stock feels slightly warm to the touch when held. A golden inscription bears the name of General Gerefein of the 7th Army of Exploration. In his most famous act, the general turned the tide of a prolonged and vicious battle with a canny Kellid warlord. Through the driving snow of a chaotic blizzard, General Gerefein shot practically blind, yet his bolt struck a lethal blow, dashing the warlord from his mount. As the Kellid soldiers watched their leader fall, they broke their charge, leaving General Gerefein the victor that day.
