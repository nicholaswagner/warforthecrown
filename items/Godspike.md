![[godspike.png]]

Godspike is a `+1 Striking` longspear.

> **This silvery weapon gleams with golden inscriptions and warms up in welcoming power to the hands of the righteous. Imbued with the spirit of the brave [[Marjorine Sandaris]], an ancient hero of the battle of Vaishali Pass, it possesses a glimmer of resolve and sentience that strengthens her wielder against the forces of evil.**

> Whenever Godspike is within `60ft from undeads or fiends`, it begins to heat up and shine like a torch. This doesn’t harm the wielder unless in exceptional cases, and does not reveal undetected or disguised creatures.

> Godspike deals `+1 Holy damage on each strike`. 


> If the wielder is Evil, they are Enfeebled 1 as long as they hold Godspike.
