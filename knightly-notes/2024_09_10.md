#### Caritas and the No-Good, Horrible, Very Bad Day
- Years later, summer afternoon/evening (around age 14), dueling in the garden with his father. They rest under the shade of a willow tree when finished.
- Rysherian Lord Protector trained.
- Madeira‚Äîkilled a üê∑ (riffing).
- Swordplay, technique, dueling.
- Father says no prejudices or racism in Rysher‚Äî"keep our eyes up and always chase the sun."
- Family receives palace guards at the house; the adults have a conversation. Hands out manacles; father is unarmed. Ren√© is shackled.
- **Memory:** The man who shackles his father is visibly unhappy about having to arrest him. Father places his shackled hands on his shoulder to comfort him as he's carted away.
- Relatives come over in reaction to the event‚Äîfather was charged with theft and smuggling with enemy countries. He is willing to agree to the charges under truth serum.
- Madeira tells Caritas great things about Rysher, gives off "military wife trying to convince children that their next move/job post is going to be great" vibes.

**Inquisitor [[General Feradica Torcamay]]**

**Milon Jeroth:**

- Truth serum is administered. The Earl limps forward and asks if the father is guilty.


  > "I have distributed food and medicines to women and children of all that were affected by our Empire."

- Turns the tables on the local government by publicly taking the serum but then says he is not guilty of breaking his oath.
- The penalty for this crime is discharge and being banned from the country, but the court digs deeper.
  - "Is it true that... you made disparaging remarks against the royals in a tavern?"
