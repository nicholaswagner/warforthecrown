# Scooby Gang
- Failed check
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] is mid lockpick on [[Arturo Basri]]'s stateroom when they are interrupted by some knights.
	- Arturo was on lookout
- Failed check
- [[Tirri-Kastner]] is now on lookout
	- Knights of the swancrest - "Mam is everything alright?"
	- TK makes a weak excuse
	- Knight mentions they are on alert on account of the recent assassination attempt, the nightswan is mentioned,
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] successfully lockpicks Arturo's previous room (with a 31!!) and we go inside
	- very large room, large canapy bed, plants in pots, a minibar
	- TK casts detect magic
	- C checks the bed to make sure no one is here
	- TK stands lookout
	- Z uses darkvision to look around, Arturo helps
		- Z finds the potted tree which has some very small droplets of wine that have stained the bark
		- mini moment where the camera cuts to [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] making a note that TK knew to put pillows down around the base of the door to muffle noise and block out light
		- Z smells golden pair fruit, pleasant loamy soil, and the party pets go to town on the fruit
		- Z checks the painting, its a heavy painting but mundane
- What's odd:
	- the room has been serviced since [[Arturo Basri]] was forced out of it
	- on the bed, in the corner of the sham there is a little soft lump
	- [[Arturo Basri]] pokes it and pulls it out
	- as he pulls it out something flutters out, its a little silk handkerchief
		- as it falls open there is writing scrawled on the hankerchief
		- hurried scrawl, dark maroon colored ink
		- > "lord basri sorry i fled, hearing the count outside your door made me flee in fear, i hope to conclude our rendezvous in stackies"
		- the lines of the letter are fine
	- Z - observes that it would have been easy for the servants to overlook this while cleaning up because of how busy everyone would be during this festival
	- Z - cleans up the evidence
	- Arturo goes to close the windows and looks over the grounds while he's doing that
		- he sees the guards making their rounds
		- sees a figure moving / wandering / slowly
		- pale feminine figure - diaphanous white gown flowing in the breeze

### Finding the Library
- the bois go hunting for the library
- lots of stealthy shenannigans
- end up in a small cubbord and the door makes a loud latching sound as we close the door
- it echos throughout the hall and guards sounds are heard as they make their rounds
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] holds up the everlight crystal to see what room they are in
	- there is a pool of water, statues of angels, muses, etc
	- reflecting pool:  a sign of opulance
		- odd though, there's no glass ceiling which you would normally expect, instead its pure white marble
		- as the light bounces around whispers are heard coming from the water
		- [[Arturo Basri]] has [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] point the light back into the water and as he does the whispers come again
		- A checks to see if his reflection is as expected
			- he notices a thin black outline of a circle that shows up in the mirror but isn't on his hand outside of it
			- A is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt:  This is HIS handiwork. (his style).  And as he looks further he sees other tattoos on himself that look like they were done by himself. (his style, his techniques etc
	- Basri is fixed for a moment and [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] and [[Caritas Zespire]] to a much lesser extent notice how freaked he is.  Rhen prompts the two to leave and move on for now.
	- As the bois are leaving the room the camera sees [[Caritas Zespire]] look back at the pool with a suspicious eye
	- ... scraping sounds of metal on metal coming from behind us

### The girls in the garden
- footprints of bare feet
- secluded garden / statue / fountain , secret garden vibe to some extent.  Depiction of two lovers in the throws of a dance, fountain is not flowing, a bit of brackish water
- sitting at the fountain is [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] who has set out a tea service from the palace
- she does not make eye contact / her attention is not drawn to Z and TK, and she is sitting on the lip of the fountain as if she's in conversation with someone.
- "You're hardly touching your tea, would you like some more?"
- Z attempts an occultists check:  
	- Z does not sense a presence here
	- There is a tear on her nightgown, it has a split
- SC - says she is going to have some more and dips her tea cup into the brackish water
- SC reaches down and digs deep into the cobblestones and soil and mud and there is a worm in between her fingers
	- she looks down at the worm:  "Spoiled, spoiled, rotten down to the center" and she crushes the worm in her palm.
	- as she leans down her neglige slips and one of her breasts slips out of the nightgown.  Low on one of her breasts you see a wound of some sort 
- Z sneaks up on [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] a bit and tries to get a closer look
	- Z sees that its not just a single wound but two

... (nick is afk for a minute or two and missed this)

- looks like the wound is a day or two old. 

- "Over and over and over" and [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] walks back to the guest house where she and her mother are staying. (she leaves the teacup)

...

### 3 men and a selly
- Arturo speaks in our heads we are goign to run in 3....2...1 
- ...
- a jumble of armor - helmet rolled away 
- selly
- hidden passages
- "We are at the mercy of an 8 year old child ... and also we have baron okkerra's child with us" - Rhenquist
- the bois and their child continue exploring ...
- we open the door and step inside
- soaring high ceilings three stories tall
	- large pieces of the wall are missing and instead there is sparkling golden netting with jewels overhanging giant multi story windows
	- branches crisscross above the netted opening
	- a tittering of nightingales chirping in discordant and unsettling sounds
	- an area of the wall containing bird cages
	- one large cage is open the door swings back and forth, 
		- seraphena nightglass warbler
		- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] recognizes what this is and tells us to be silent
		- "quiet, quiet, listen, hide hide hide, "
		- Arturo says "Basritome" in response to it saying "Basritome"
		- "Basritome hide, hide, promise"
		- "graves graves ,basritome"
		- Arturo begins to frantically look for the source of the speaking
		- birds are flying / making noise etc
		- ....
		- grandfather clock chimes and thudnerous peals of the chiming rings out
		- flower petals trembling
		- [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] doesn't seem to notice
		- bong ... bong .... bong ... shadow of the clocktower warbles as it passes around an arrangement of shrubbery
		- "the count can count count can he not, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, how high can the count count" bong bong bong, 
		- Mirror, reflection not us, stone obelisks, open stairway, we run down and leave selly behind who is catatonic and her eyes are rolled back up into her head.

### Garden girls
fatigued, distortion in view, by the time the girls think "i should count, they've missed it"
overgrown and untended garden area.  The girls take note that these shrubs are so obviously untended.  Z remembers as a child she thought it was unusual that the count was so specific that these go un-tended.

- TK gets her hands deep into that shrubbery (thinking of the long sleeved gloves she will have to wear tomorrow to cover the scrapes she'll get doing this)
- She pulls the shrubs apart enough to see a scorch mark.  Something was drawn here, some kind of design.
- TK makes religion check - **rolls a dirty 30**
	- results were secret - texted to her by the dm

### silence
- everlight stone lighting our path
- stairs open up to a black obsidian stone room
- previous room was white
- sooooo cold
- small chapel of some sort
	- alter at back
	- small pool or fountain on a pedestal
	- when peer in, no water, only black sand
- looking around the room we see a statue behind the alter of a woman sitting on a throne
- hair is carved to be floating around her face, but statue has been tipped over and tipped off its ledge, pieces of the hair have been broken off, carvings are marring her face
- paintings, tapestries, carvings, all desecrated and defaced, positioned in unholy ways
- arturo runs his hands over the surfaces of the black alter, his fingers find carved words on the top of the alter, done by amateurish hands,
- "what can not be seen can not be weighed, the ledger is blind",
- statues / carvings are dedicated to [[Pharasma]] the goddess of death
- no dust in here

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] "so how did you think that was going to go"


... up the stairs, 5, 6, 7, BONG....
The chimes stop and selly collapses to the floor



----

These shrubs conceal the image of [[Pharasma]].  Shrubs were planted around and were allowed to grow up to conceal what lies beneath.


---

Caritas picks up Selly, 
The bois back track their way back to the rooms where everyone is staying.

Carit takes Selly to Z and TK.

Is this normal?  Rhenquist does a bit:  "of course fam"


We have breakfast and then leave
