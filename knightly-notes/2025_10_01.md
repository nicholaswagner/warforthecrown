Players recapped the previous session (badly) and we moved on to the "fit check" where the players describe what they are wearing for this recital they are about to attend.

[[Dame Parthena Crabbe]] welcomes the party to the event...

[[Caritas Zespire]] ... (mostly quiet due to botox and lip filler treatments that he got in moost today)

DC 
- downplays the expectations for the recital today
- compliments [[Allister Hound]] on his speech that he gave at the count's event recently

The party arrives at the conservatory
- professors are in red robes
- white and red - students
- we spot merchant children with a sense of entitlement
- we spot scholarship kids who really want to be there
- sculptures are on display
- lots of vivid bright colors
- [[Allister Hound]] spots a painting of birds that is uniquely good
	- artist credit is given to:  finnias saulk and sepsinia crabb
- some traveller songs are sung, its a wonderful performance
- [[Caritas Zespire]] just has a surprised expression on his face all night due to the "wasp stings" by the local priests of calestra.
- DC introduces [[Liewellyn Melle]] to the party
	- "the sad story of the vales" - father died or disappeared.  
	- LM gets a zinger in to [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] as she leaves: "Lord Merosett, should you ever decide to look outside the family for a match, please let me know."
- [[Allister Hound]] taps his glass and makes a quick speech
	- "can we all give a quick thank you to DC for her fine work" *polite applause*
	- compliments the students on their performances
	- we thank you all for your time and your performance
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] finds a little emo girl who is making notes on her composition notebook who is avoiding the socializing of it all
	- compliments her on her performance
- [[Allister Hound]] is approached by a young / teenage boy after the performance
	- i don't mean to impose on you, but your accent sounded andorean so i thought i'd come and introduce myself.
	- AH introduces himself as A. Hound-Clement, and the boy is confused.
	- The boy tells him that the Hounds are essentially Saints in his house.
	- The Hounds apparently helped establish the bellflower network which would smuggle enslaved people out of chelliax
	- The hell-nights killed the Hound clan. "Yes, I know ... I was there"
	- The teenager is named [[Finnegan Salk]]
	- Allister asks the teen to join him for a quick walk
		- Finn ... I'm here to help Sepsinia.  Is there anything you can tell me? One Andoran to another ... Did anything happen?  I want to help her, but if you're involved I want to help you too.  I'm not saying that you are, but IF you are, i want to help you.
		- Finn thinks its his fault that [[Opilio]] is dead and that [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] is the way she is.  He's ashamed of himself and the role he played.
		- F came for the conservatory from [[Andoran]]. When he got here he was unfamiliar with the local customs.  He was made fun of a lot. example: stirring his tea the wrong direction.  He would hide in the library where he met Sepsinia and they became fast friends.
		- She was a painter, he was a musician Opillio ( played the harpsichord).
		- F gave advice to Opillio to attract Sepsinia's attention.  recommended a book:  "they lay of xxx" its about Madiri the goddess of tragedy, romance, and suicide.
		- F helped Opillio craft a love letter for Sepsinia where he asks her to join him for a picnic.
		- Afterwards she confessed she didn't have a great time but that she went because of the letter and she felt obligated.
		- He came back convinced that he had won her heart and her affections.
		- He wrote his parents who then wrote dame crabbe to negotiate their betrothal.  (it was over a matter of weeks)
		- [[Allister Hound]] puts his hand on [[Finnegan Salk]]'s shoulder
			- Kid, I don't think you're to blame.  You were just trying to help a friend.  You're not responsible.
			- "If you're scholarship is ever in jeopardy I want you to write me.  I'll take care of it."
	- [[Allister Hound]] tells the group what he learned from [[Finnegan Salk]]
	---
	[[Arturo Basri]] returns with "the book"
	- I found a book about a watery fae, who wears a shawl, if you control the shawl, you control the fey if you control the fey, you can control others.
	- TK casts detect magic - none
	- The boy must not have even read to the end.  (its a tragedy).  Arturo thinks the boy was trying to get the shawl to control Sepsinia's feelings.
	- The fae prefer to be left alone with their body of water. They will fight if someone approaches them in their body of water.  massive advantage against people in the water.  If they kiss you ... you drown.

### Leave Sepsinia Alone!

- The party returns to Bellavora (Dame Crabbe's home)
- The party heads up to Sep's room.
- Caritas decides to stay outside her room for propriety's sake
- Sepsinia twitches violently in her sleep.  
- TK tries to wake sepsinia from slumber but she does not awaken
- [[Allister Hound]] attempts to cast dispel magic on sleeping Sepsinia
	- "Sepsinia ... its time to wake up"
	- she's not under a rewrite memory spell or one that can be 'cast'.  Its being tampered with as an effect of another effect that's being cast on her.
	- Allister see's sepsinia's POV.
		- surrounded by hedges around a gazebo at night
		- boy standing near her with well kept blond hair
		- "what could possibly be so urgent that you need to see me here in the dark of night?"
		- he's in love with her, his parents are on their way here to arrange the marriage
		- sepsinia tries again and again to explain (delicately) that she does not share his feelings for her
		- he goes full crazy and gets angry
		- she gets angry in return and tells him its never going to happen not even if he's the last man on earth.
		- he grabs for her hand and she tears away her arm which tears the clothing on her arm
		- she runs into the hedgemaze on the grounds which she knows and he doesn't.  she runs back to the safety of her home knowing that he might be stranded there all night.
		- camera cut to another night sitting under the gazebo having tea with Opillio, on another night, and on another night, and again, and again, and again.

The party sees sepsinia sleep shuffling and follows her

She walks down the main hall, passes by the front door and goes all the way to the servants wing walking through an unremarkable door.

We follow silently through the kitchen into a back room (a pantry) where a servants entrance exists.  She opens the door and steps out into the cold foggy night.  Jerky twitchy movement continues, but she speeds up as she reaches the outdoors.

The hedgemaze grows unnaturally chilly as she approaches the hedge-maze where she momentarily pauses and then enters in.

---

The party enters the maze
As soon as we enter, the maze is tangled and overgrown. a strange chill and an odd feeling hits us.  slithering fog undulates through the hedges.  thick vines covered in thorns stick out of the grass.  we scratch our hands and arms on thorns and roots that we dont notice.

- [[Zarissa Nocturne]]and [[Tirri-Kastner]] find themselves at a bronze statue of a woman playing a harp with a bunch of red roses (the god shaelin)
- [[Arturo Basri]] - bronze statue of woman holding hand out with carved bird perched upon it  - (god with bird, I didn't catch the name)
- [[Allister Hound]] statue of a man in a long coat with an open book and a pair of glasses on his face
- Caritas - statue of an armored knight with a pair of outstretched wings (the god Theodane)
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] - catches up with the group and examining the architecture, he finds his way to the statue of the man with the long cloak and glasses where [[Allister Hound]] is.



--

[[Arturo Basri]] - realizes he's alone and lost the group.
- casts message:  "hey allister, l've lost everyone look up" **casts some magic**.   Its not very effective to communicate where he is to allister.

[[Tirri-Kastner]] & [[Zarissa Nocturne]] stumble into a stone column of an elf woman's head and face.  beautiful face, but mouth is smirking.  There is a buzzing sound and wasps (callistria)) are buzzing over the face of the busts.

[[Allister Hound]] & [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] - find [[Arturo Basri]] next to shaelin's statue with the bird.

[[Caritas Zespire]] - "everybody is lost but me"
- sees a light
- statue of young woman with cropped hair one foot pose holding a lanturn (its Daria)

--

[[Arturo Basri]] investigates the statue - its a piece of art (well made) to the hopeful lovelyness of the god shaelin.

[[Tirri-Kastner]] and [[Zarissa Nocturne]] - statue of woman in armor, hooded cloak, holding a sword in hand.  the statue is covered in flowering vines but along the length of the sword the flowers begin to die and decay

[[Caritas Zespire]] - **failed check**  slashes his way through a hedgemaze wall and confidently walks out the entrance to the hedgemaze back into the night's air

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] [[Allister Hound]] and [[Arturo Basri]] find themselves in a clearing with a fountain / trickle of water / overturned bowl of water with flower petals into a dry-ish pool of water with carved bronze swans.  
	- what's odd?  the air is getting thicker and the air is chillier
	- they hear some faint harpsichord music

--

[[Caritas Zespire]], [[Zarissa Nocturne]], [[Tirri-Kastner]] - 
- sweet perfume of roses, we see the statue of shaelin with her harp

[[Allister Hound]], [[Rhenquist-Merosett]], [[Allister Hound]] - 
- find themselves in a field of blooming flowers with a statue of shaelin mid dance
- they all hear the harpsichord music

--
AAR: get lost again, find themselves at the hooded woman with the sword statue. (The god Arasne)

CZT:  find themselves at the water feature with shaelin pouring water from the upturned bowl

--

AAR:  split up and go in three different directions.

[[Caritas Zespire]] finds [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] and [[Allister Hound]]
[[Zarissa Nocturne]] ends up back at the Daria statue
[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] - finds his way out

---
[[Tirri-Kastner]] - finds herself at a statue of caden caylin (i think)?  guy holding a mug of ale
[[Caritas Zespire]] gets lost and finds himself at the Frav statue
[[Zarissa Nocturne]] finds herself at the "harpsichord spot"
[[Tirri-Kastner]] - is out!

---
[[Zarissa Nocturne]] - arasne statue

[[Caritas Zespire]] - is out!

---
[[Zarissa Nocturne]] ... ... ... eventually gets out!

### We're out!
The party clears the hedgemaze and there are thick briars of thorned roses.
Disturbing scene.  A rought iron breakfast table surrounded by four chairs with a grisley pantomime of tea time.
The tables are set with rotting food.
three purtrified bodies sitting in the chairs, reaching their hands out pawing at the table having knocked the silverware off the table. (undead actively moving)
in the fourth chair is sepsinia staring blankly with glassy eyes in her strange sleep paralysis.
huge rose bush with thorny bushes.  a weather worn and rotting harpsichorn (or on the harpsichord) is a human heart swollen to twice its size.  bones are jutting out of the heart that are skittering around and flexing like legs.  the central aeorta splits into two spider like mandibles.  its playing the harpsichord. As the party sees them the music stops.
The heart jumps onto sepsinia and it gives a blood curdling scream.  The three dead corpses turn and look at us.  Three glorian aristocrats in what used to be fine travelling clothes.  As they see us they begin to rise from the table.
