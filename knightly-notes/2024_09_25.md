[[Princess Eutropia Stavian]] is giving a speech:

_[[Rhenquist-Merosett]], [[Arturo Basri]], and [[Caritas Zespire]] notice a female servant with a purple brick. Rhen and Arturo corner the girl and take the brick (it's magic—will upset a bunch of bees in the apiary). She claims a guard gave it to her and asked her to place it in the apiary._

_Unaware of this, [[Princess Eutropia Stavian]] continues her speech:_

> ... Tonight we revisit primogeniture ... _cheering / clapping / raised glasses ..._
