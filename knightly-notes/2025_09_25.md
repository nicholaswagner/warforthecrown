### Bad News
We open with the party having just discovered the stack of wilted rose issue #6 leaflets on a table at the Crabb Residence.

The party has some chaotic reactions to the news.

**realization**
> nononononononnonononononononononono --caritas


The door opens and [[Dame Parthena Crabbe]] bursts in

---
### Honesty is the best policy
- The party thanks D for her work with the Wilted Rose issue
- DC invites us into the dining room
- The name plates have been obviously swapped to sit [[Caritas Zespire]] next to [[Sepsinia Crabbe]]
- DC recognizes [[Allister Hound]] who has some melon slices before him.
- In honor of xxxx we should all go around the table and say what dog we should be
- A toast is made to the glorian empire and the extinction of the Andorran hound
- DC mentions  that she has a few scholarship boys at her conservatory at the moment (fundraising is mentioned)

> "What's eating Sepsinia Crabbe"

- That story in the WR today about Eutropia ... D is going to begin having some "red dresses" crafted for her and [[Sepsinia Crabbe]]
- The topic of [[Eldrin Vale]] comes up, DC makes some very polite above the table comments about how Caritas's and EV's betrothal is not yet finalized and "anything could happen"
- DC makes a comment about how the Glorian Empire created music / culture - etc etc
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] brings up [[Baron Telllus]] and asks how we might get in touch with them.
- If a dispute occurred in stachys that would require [[Baroness Adella Voinum]]'s  attention it would first have to go through Baron Tellus.
- port has been served, [[Dame Parthena Crabbe]]'s eyes keep drifting to [[Sepsinia Crabbe]]'s empty chair.  She dabs at the corner of her eye and requests our assistance. 
-

### What's eating [[Sepsinia Crabbe]]
DC asks the party for their help with Sepsinia.  She gives us background info on Sepsinia.
- DC considered asking [[Baron_Niklaus_Okerra.png]]
- Sepsinia seemed to take the news of [[Opilio]]'s suicide well, and after a brief period she seemed like herself.  A talented painter.
- Even [[Archbanker Lady Paril]] has seen her and thinks its just grief
- S used to sleepwalk but it eventually stopped, now its started up again
- S used to admit to having nightmares ()nothing specific), but soon stopped confiding in her mother
- DC's husband passed 3 years ago
- DC believes S's behavior is beyond grief but she knows her daughter and is convinced this is something more
- She knows we have a follower of the wanderer and an investigator of some renown, so she shot her shot.  She injected her self into the Wilted Rose news and defended [[Tirri-Kastner]] publicly hoping to gain our favor.

### They do not go through the door
[[Arturo Basri]]  and [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] go off to explore the Tower.
- A asks R to unlock the tower door which is locked
- R is unable to unlock the door (18 lockpick check)
- "Efficiency is always in the basri name"
- "perhaps we ask for a key in the morning" - [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]
- A mentions that we just dealt with Ghoul fever in bogs and the supernatural, and suggests that there may be something supernatural going on here

### Tirri discovers a hidden art talent
[[Tirri-Kastner]] and [[Zarissa Nocturne]] are currently in a velvet wall papered room with pink peyone flowers.  Very pink.  Mattresses that are like 6 inches where you totally sink into them when you lay on them.
- they are unable to hear a thing outside their rooms.
- they feel fairly confident that [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] did not go sleep walking during the night.

---

### The Breakfast Club

Some tabletalk at the breakfast table in the morning....
"How did everyone sleep lastnight?"

> Mark as Allister: "Have you ever felt like you slept all night in your mother's loving embrace?" Kori:  "How would Allister know?"


The party decides on their investigation priorities for the day
- [[Allister Hound]] thinks that [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] may have killed [[Opilio]]
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] shares a memory from the Tan Jubilee where they saw Sepsinia partially unclothed and witnessed some extremely large (fang) marks (two of them) on her chest / breasts.
- TK mentions she has a spell that could potentially provide some insight.  If she is cursed, she might be able to claim a curse for 5 minutes.
- [[Allister Hound]] - wants to go into town and dig up dirt on the boy
- [[Arturo Basri]] - wants to investigate the bog
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] wants to use a potion of memory sharing
- [[Tirri-Kastner]] wants to take sepsinia's curse onto herself for 5 minutes if there is one
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] will go with [[Arturo Basri]]
---

### The Bog
- Its actually not one of the cranberry bogs
- smaller sized bog compared to the cranberry bogs, the water seems pretty shallow maybe 3 ft deep or so.
- there is a sluce grate that is used to "overfill" the cranberries in the winter and this bog is one of the ones used as a water reserve which will be drained and used to fill the others.
- notices a series of deep puncture marks around the soft area around the bog
	- tracks of a very unusual sort.  Almost like spikes were drilled into the ground.
	- some kind of large probably eight legged creature walked here that walked near the water and then back to the town
	- probably a cat sized spider

### 
![[zarissa-and-sepsinia-tea-time.png]]
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] learns that Sepsinia is in her bedroom
- Z goes down to the servants and grabs a snack for Sepsinia and then brings it to her door and knocks... upon no reply, she pushes open the door and lets herself in
- Notices an easel with a blank canvas on it on a table with some paints neatly arranged but untouched.  Seps is sitting at the window just gazing out blankly
- Z asks her to go out for a walk, "No thank you".  "Will you help me with something? It won't take long."
	- "Are you afraid of spiders?"
	- monosyllabic responses
	- "you may have seen something at the Tan Jubilee ... will you help me? I need you to remember the last time you had your heart hurt ... physically i mean."
	- Z hands her a potion
- [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] takes the potion and immediately goes into convulsions
- Z is hit with a fog and lightning strike like vibes where she struggles to make out any specifics or details of the memory.
- *makes occultism check* 24 - Z understands quickly that S is under the effects of a powerful memory modification effect.

---
### Investigating the house
[[Tirri-Kastner]] - 
- makes a perception check (Shannon got a nat 20!)
- notices a painting of a rose
- TK slices open the painting and discovers a letter from [[Opilio]]

---

### Caritas speaks with the Ladys maid 
- speaks with the lady's maid Macy
- > I remember her time of mourning after the young mr rosso passed away.
- morned for about a month or so
- difficult ... not a lot of black clothing in the house so i remember having to rush around to find some.  She mourned for as short a time as was possible, but then again she hadn't known him long.  
- his family came up from Cassamire (capital of tandak prefecture, navel shipyard).  family came up and discovered he was dead when they arrived.
- Seps returned to the conservatory, then came back for the summer, still fine... but nightmares began a few days after she returned.

### The Coach House

[[Allister Hound]] and [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] go about town and inquire about the [[Opilio]] boy.
- horse / carriage themed, second floor has a large patio area overlooking the taproom's main area.
- its fall / chilly weather

- [[Moost]] is not a very large town so they head over to "The Coach House" where the locals hang out
- patron wearing professors robes and a bartender
- [[Allister Hound]] - bartender - 6ft 6 tall blond hair neatly cut, ripped body, looks like he can bench press an anvil, very nice bright teeth
	- "first drink is free for a noble like yourself sir" he says noticing [[Allister Hound]]'s fancy ring
	- offers to mix a "Zespire" if he likes... Allister asks if there's anything else. *womp womp* he asks for whiskey.
	- "Rhondel" is the bartender's name.  He's "Olphin" a viking-ish culture
		- his father served in the Olphin guard under the prev grand prince
	- Allister downplays his nobility
	- Rhondel mentioned his wife Marline who tends to the horses
	- A discovers that the conservatory kids have been rehearsing the last few days for a special performance for her guests.  They've been working "overtime".
	- A asks a question:  "We've been hearing talk about DC's daughter Sep.  She was betrothed to a student there ... did he ever come in here?"
	- He doesn't know anything about the gentleman but hears plenty about Sep.
	- Not too many people talk about the boy that died, but talk about Sep.  The town is concerned.  She seems sickly, and we worry she might die.  You ever hear of that little town called Stachys?  Its a little town that doesn't appear on maps... its unimportant.  Their nobleman died and the town quickly fell into disrepair and became irrelevant. 

- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] - professor wearing white and red robes. hair slicked back.  sitting by himself, nursing a glass by himself.
	- may I join you? I assume you're a professor at the conservatory by your robes
	- the professor Craisen offers that he's on a break from rehearsing
	- Rhen cozies up to the professor and softly says "I've heard some rumors about [[Opilio]]" while i've been here and they peaked my interest... 
		- professors mood darkens
		- you'll forgive me, its such an unpleasant topic, many were moved by his passing.  He wasn't a scholarship boy of course, but many students were distraught when he passed.
		- his friend Finnigan Saulk was quite distraught as well.
		- 

**camera cuts back to Allister and Rhondel**
- .. "well, how have you been enjoying moost since you've been here?"
	- Dame crabbe's house is quite wonderful but this tavern is more my theme
	- "Have you been to the cranberry bogs yet? you just have to look out for the wolf spiders? They're the size of cats and mostly attack ducks and geese"
	- Rumors and local legends .. the bog witch etc... 
	- "A beautiful naked woman alone in the bog". "Sounds like something a lonely man would make up"... "Not sure that's something either of us would be interested in huh?" ... The two exchange a look
		- bartender mentions he used to provide protection for folks when they were traveling and settled down
		- [[Allister Hound]] presses for a name of someone he worked with and the bartender prevaricates
	- mentions a carriage crash a few months back.  Driver + four passengers tipped off the road and fell down the cliff side.  three of the passengers died, people spread rumors it was bandits, the night swan, a giant spider , crazy rumors.
	- [[Allister Hound]] asks if Rhondel is here all the time.  He says that we'll be back soon and sabatages [[Arturo Basri]] and [[Caritas Zespire]]'s future prospects at the ONLY tavern in town.

- [[Tirri-Kastner]] shares that she found a letter in the back of a painting of a rose
- She found the boys suicide note
	- "he's sure that she will tell her mother about their sexual congress.  she will twist the event and reframe it so that she becomes a saint and him the assaulter.  He is unable to live with this slow-hanging that she is preparing for him and so he will drown himself in the bog."
- [[Arturo Basri]] says he found evidence of a cat sized spider walking around the bog and mentions the shallowness of the bog's water level and that it would take a very VERY intentional effort to drown one's self.
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] makes an occultism roll:  result: 29! Critical Success!
	- what spell could be this powerful? `rewrite memory` is powerful enough and the correct type of magic.
	- what could undo this type of effect?
		- a number of spells can handle it.  spell can be undone with thing that counter it.  `dispel magic` etc.
		- would this spell explain the other weird stuff? `no. there's something else going on as well`
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]: 
	- ... manages the group chaos
- [[Allister Hound]]: 
	- suggests that druids might be involved
