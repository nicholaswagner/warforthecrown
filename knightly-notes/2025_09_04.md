[[Allister Hound]] , [[Tirri-Kastner]] , [[Marjorine Gagrus]] , [[Salus children]], and [[Juna Salus]] and the sick get into the carriage which is on the way to visit the cathedral of the wealthy father in Lothedar ...


[[Allister Hound]] and [[Tirri-Kastner]] are having a quiet word ... 
- they discuss [[Anllel Oakleaf]],  A is not a fan.
- A spills the tea on all his fellow party members to TK
- The two chat for a bit about A's new responsibilities

Hours go by.  TK eventually falls asleep in the carriage.  Allister and [[Juna Salus]] are the only two awake.
- Juna thanks A for helping them and wonders why
- A tells her that when he was about her sick son's age, both his parents died and he was taken in by the church of Abadar ... (he loses the thread as he seems to get lost in his memories for a moment) ... any way, I wouldn't be able to look at myself if I didn't help.
- Juna - [[Portimer Salus]] is a good man, but he was raised to work in the mill, and when the mill broke down we struggled ... and then when the boys came ... Who expects triplets?!  He decided to work the farm to make things work.  He's angry with how his life has turned out, and i'm sure we'll have more words in the future, but we're grateful.
- A knows that Portimer's words were a reflection of the current situation and he didn't take them personally.
- > many of us in stachys learned to stop dreaming a long time ago

### In the office of the Archbanker

- All are welcome to the cathedral of the wealthy father, though I believe that you are here to withdrawl and not deposit
- [[Allister Hound]] carefully broaches the topic of the "disease" issue with Stachys
- She mentions that these services are very expensive ... 
	- too expensive for a goat herder and a farmer to afford.  
	- A says he will be paying.
	- [[Archbanker Lady Paril]] disapproves "What will happen when the next peasant in Stachys falls ill ... "  Will he pay for them too?  And when he can no longer handle the financial burden will the people then say that he's playing favorites?
	- "May I be frank Allister?"  The [[Archbanker Lady Paril]] knows the state of the stach and the state of the palace of birbsong
	- ** an ability check is made and allister passes with flying colors**. The banker is impressed and offers him a deal
	- A magical deal is struck and [[Allister Hound]] agrees on behalf of stachys to perform a favor for her in the future

### Gooselighting
[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] is acting as honorary tribune while [[Allister Hound]] is AFS.
A half orc arrives carrying a bucket in one hand and dozens of colored ribbons in the other.
Each ribbon is attached to a different goose.  
- "who dealt it?!"
- apparently the geese are flatulent
- the bucket of grain is placed in front of [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]
- The feed has been infected with wart seed.  It makes the geese gassy.
- "Can you identify a monetary loss that you have suffered as a result of this?"
- The farmer doesn't care about the money, he wants the children's hands.
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] asks [[Portimer Salus]] if his children did this.
- [[Portimer Salus]] ... i mean... I've had a lot going on with my child dying... honestly.. this sounds like something they would do maybe?
- Rhen assigns the boys to work part time twice a week at the Orc's farm until their debt is paid off.
- Rhen is savage AF to the dad re: the Tribune of Stachy's currently taking his child to get healed in Lothidar while

- The bois have a heart to heart
- "Right now that Druid is running Stachys" - Allister
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] offers to give Allister a hand with any lessor tasks so Allister can focus on what he feels matters most

An Aberation ... its from a world not from this one.. an UtYug?  Its looked down on in polite society... it feeds on filth and trash.


Puuuuuuump?  pummmmmmmmp puuummmmmmmp.

[[Arturo Basri]] - pulls out his crossbow and takes down a random bird that is flying by and it falls into the water right next to the lurker.

APPPPEEEEAAASSSSEEEEEED

[[Allister Hound]] makes a deal with the lurker who will abandon the "no-face-queen" if we feed him more.
