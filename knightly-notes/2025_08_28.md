### An interruption during breakfast
The party is finishing their breakfast when there is a knock at their front door.  Their man answers and there is a child who asks for the Tribune.  The child has also brought their dog into the house.

[[Allister Hound]]  is told that the sheriff has caught a witch and there's rumbling that the town wants to burn them
- A calls the party together "Ok, we gotta go deal with this ... and we are NOT going to fuck around..."
- A asks Art to blend into the background and see if he see's anything
- The party takes the carriage to the town
---
The party arrives at the [[wolfs whisker]] 
- [[Caritas Zespire]] steps out first and attempts to announce that the Tribune of Stachys has arrived - Nick rolled a 2 +9 = 11.  Carit stumbles a bit while stepping out of the carriage and his voice isn't heard well
- [[Allister Hound]] 
	- casts a cantrip - "Quiet!"
	- points to [[Jo Sini]] who was loudly calling for the witch to be brought out.
	- [[Caritas Zespire]] posts up by the front door and tries to look a bit intimidating

[[Arturo Basri]] - overhears:
- did you hear that xxxx and their boy got sick over night ... good thing the sheriff's caught the witch, we need to burn her and get this taken care of

#### Meanwhile inside with Onora

[[Onora Piscum]]:
- went by margerie's place and i caught someone loitering around her property.  When i saw them she was making her way towards the well and her livestock.   I've got her down in the cellar, tied up.  I've never seen this lady before in my life and she won't say anything to me.

[[Allister Hound]] asks [[Zarissa Nocturne]] to go down into the cellar and speak with the person tied up down there.

[[Zarissa Nocturne]] heads down to the cellar .. smells of yeast and hops from the brewing equipment and bottles of ale aging all around
- she approaches a an unknown woman ( [[Anllel Oakleaf]] )
- "They have already passed judgement on me, why should I speak to you? You look like you're one of them."
- "Do I really look like them to you?  You seen a lot of people around here with purple skin and horns?"
- She's uncooperative and feels like everyone's already judged her.
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] does not notice any obvious familiar 
- The captive notices [[Primrose]]'s shaved state and assumes that Zarissa has been mistreating her, but she shares her name. [[Anllel Oakleaf]]
- "everyone is tied to nature", "some people are just more aware of how closely they are tied than others"
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] asks if she will share her story, but if that makes her uncomfortable she could take a potion to share her memory
	- The potion is consumed and Z see's flashes of memory:
		- flashes of memory - a person arrives with a goat in tow, 'archdruids of the lodge, we found this goat and we can not determine its illness.'
		- flash - 'arcane / druidic rituals' are performed, it is determined that someone must journey forth and discover the source of this illness
		- flash - 'Oakleaf''s POV taking samples from various farms etc.
	- zarissa determines that [[Anllel Oakleaf]] is not a threat but an investigator
	- "how was I to know these townfolk weren't doing this on purpose?  I had no reason to trust them"

- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] tells the party inside that she's a druid investigator from the druids of the wildwood lodge
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] - points out that if she is indeed from the The lodge / the woods of the verdigris expanse, she's well outside the treaty / in violation
- [[Allister Hound]] goes down to visit with her
	- pulls up a stool:  "I gotta ask you, and I don't mean to come across as condescending ... but do you _want_ to live?  ... then HELP US "
	- asks why she snuck around in the middle of the night
	- "not the infertility... noooooo not that one!"
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] - will you work with us to help find a cure?
- [[Anllel Oakleaf]] says we should burn her because it would bring the wrath of the lodge down on this land
- Oakleaf doesn't trust The people of Stachys and they don't trust her

---
### Meanwhile outside ...
[[Portimer Salus]] has arrived.  This father has been up all night tending to his child who is sick and barely hanging on.

Things are getting really intense, Portimer demands that they bring out the witch and people 

[[Arturo Basri]] - tries to speak with Portimer and port takes him down to the ground.

[[Caritas Zespire]] - also tries to speak with portimer.  He makes an earnest / soft request

[[Arturo Basri]] & [[Caritas Zespire]] think they should probably get the prisoner out of there.  [[Arturo Basri]] passes that message along to the tribune.  [[Allister Hound]] & [[Onora Piscum]] are quietly talking about how to handle this.  A offers P plausible deniability and she should leave.

---

### The tribune of stachys opens the front door and walks out.  The crowd quiets down a bit while they are waiting to hear what he has to say...
[[Allister Hound]] asks for a moment of silence to think about [[Portimer Salus]]'s child who is fighting for their life right now.  As are the others who are currently affected by this right now.  An attack on one of us and an attack on all of us.  I know I'm new, but I care. I'm trying to do what I can.  At the end of the day my heart is in it.  The woman found lurking around the house, doing things that many of us would think sus.

Sometimes, battles are bigger than one town ... bigger than one village... today this battle is bigger than stachy's itself.  The woman in there is not a witch.  I can tell you that.  But she is a Druid from the Wildwood Lodge from the Verdigre Expanse.  I'm sure you all know.  The pact grants her immunity and its not what I want, nor is it what I think is deserved.  She is being sent to Lothidar to be seen to by the Count.

In the meantime, I want you to know that I myself and the other lords of Swanmere are healthy, are well cared for, and most of all, we're alive.  I understand that this isn't the outcome that many of us want.  I fully do.   ... If you're mad, come yell at me ... at this come to me and yell at me during office hours on wealday....


... 

[[Portimer Salus]] steps forward.  With all due respect my lord but my boy might be dead by morning.  But I'll tell you this now.  Either that witch burns now here in stachys, or swanmere will.

With all due respect my lord we will have our revenge against the witch or against you... and Stachys has stood for a long time w/out a leader.

[[Allister Hound]] - Portimer:  If you kid needs more medicine, come talk to us. We're here.

---
### Meanwhile inside...

The inside team frees this druid... 
They make a stealth role.  [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] with help from [[Zarissa Nocturne]]'s aid achieves a 31 on a stealth check.  They get her out and sneak her up to [[Swanmere]].

---

### Continuing

Arturo spends 8 hours with the Salus kid and it does not go well.  He's realized that nothing he's doing at this point is helping the child and he's just managing pain at this point.


---
### Back around the table
- negotiations aren't getting anywhere.
- barbs are exchanged
- [[Allister Hound]] storms off
- [[Caritas Zespire]] goes to the kitchen to fetch a meal for [[Anllel Oakleaf]]
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] continues negotiations
...

- [[Caritas Zespire]] picks up some food from the kitchen from [[Gemma Kinsey]] the chef at [[Swanmere]], returns to the table, eats a small bit to show it isn't poisoned, and leaves.
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] gives [[Caritas Zespire]] a really strange look like "did you just do that?"
- [[Caritas Zespire]] heads back to the kitchen and asks [[Gemma Kinsey]] for "allister's usual snack" ... she smirks and hands him a tray with a single cigarette and a dirty martini.  C wanders off to look for Allister.  He eventually finds him in the smoking room with the lights off.  As C enters the dark room just a hand reaches out and takes the martini.

---

### Goulfever

Camera cuts back to Zarissa, Arturo, and Oak investigating the goat.
- Oak tells the party that this goat was infected with Goulfever.  Its worse than fatal because if you die from it you rise again as a goul.
	- goulfever does not happen with out the presence of the undead
	- the lodge can treat it
- Allister overhears this from the upstairs smoking window as they investigate this goat outside

---

### Decisions
Everyone but [[Caritas Zespire]] is in the smoking room with [[Allister Hound]] discussing what to do.

Camera cuts to [[Caritas Zespire]]:
> ... and Its just awful Kinsey, Oak doesn't trust Allister, Allister doesn't trust oak.. both of them are hangry and no one seems to be willing to give ground... Its just so overwhelming you know? ... 

Camera pans down: 
![[Pace Kinsey.png]]

[[Pace Kinsey]] is just looking up at C with wide eyes and an "I really don't want to be here" expression nodding.
[[Caritas Zespire]] eats another cookie
> These are just soo good Kinsey, please thank [[Gemma Kinsey]] for me


---

### Back inside with allister
[[Allister Hound]]
> I just still don't see why you people blindly trust, a foreign asset, everything she wants and send her back home where she can do as she likes and has no obligation to help us

[[Zarissa Nocturne]] makes a case for trusting the druid, and that we have limited time to save the boy

[[Allister Hound]] stresses how little time we have and how serious everyone's conditions are

[[Tirri-Kastner]] - questions the logistics around how much it would cost to have [[Archbanker Lady Paril]] heal the sick

---
### Back outside with Oak and the Goat
> So can I kill this goat?

[[Arturo Basri]] & [[Tirri-Kastner]] nod at the same time and say "Please".

---

[[Allister Hound]] , [[Tirri-Kastner]] , [[Marjorine Gagrus]] , [[Salus children]], and [[Juna Salus]] and the sick get into the carriage 

--- 

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] heads into town to learn what he can about the pumps situation .... 

> no has been able to see or percieve what xxx is feeling... this entity has become known as the lurker.  information has come from a man named boa everette.  He has reported .... livestock ... bone picked clean by the lurker.  

> additional information is about the pupmp in that area.  pump was used to transform the marsh into useful farmland back in the day.  It connected stachys to the canal system.  because of that it was high value property and one of hte things that existed on that property was a cemetary / crypt of the sendaris family.  (margarie is related i think?)

> because the sendaris family was so important .... *couldn't hear*

> Crypt , Lurker

> Rhen learns from Urshal ... the oldest man.
They story is that [[Marjorine Gagrus]] sendaris, hero of the shining crucide, after having been involved in this grusome battle with undead, when she returned she had been infacted with some sort of illness form the gouls.  She rose up during her coffin during the wake and attack...

And we will continue on the Sixth of Rova ...
