### _The night continues_
> When we last left off, [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] and [[Tirri-Kastner]] were in the room with [[Dame Trant]] who was threatening [[Senator-Amadorian-Dou]], who has her hand on her non peace-tied sword on the second floor side room on the senate floor.

	- (the children are difficult terrain) ðŸ¤£

[[Dame Trant]]

[[Senator-Amadorian-Dou]] is grateful for our help, [[Caritas Zespire]] thanks him for supporting the premogeniture vote (to reverse it)

[[Caritas Zespire]] shakes [[Lord Remilliard Kastner]]'s hand and thanks him for his assistance in the fight as he leaves

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] wraps some bandages around [[Caritas Zespire]]'s waist ... Carit maybe likes it?

[[Tirri-Kastner]] - casts some healing around the party!  

---

#### As night continues ...

_In the Gallery_
[[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] runs in to the [[Grand Duchess Liomtraud Heskillar]] who is sucking down pink drinks in the Gallery. (unlocked a bonus for the party by succeeding on a roll of some kind but i missed it)She spots a sphinx cat behind a pillar, goes to check it out but when she rounds the corner nothing is there.

_Imperial Archives_
[[Caritas Zespire]] attempts to sway the archives with a diplomacy roll (doesn't succeed)
runs into [[Viscountess Octavia Nicodemus]] aka the oldest woman in the world who is just standing there stroking books.  

> THIS IS A LIBRARY! 

Carit goes full deer in headlights and freezes for a moment then slowly backs away.  Messages the group:  "Wow, Nicodemus is ... spooooooky"

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]]
Runs into his Cousin Sopristian who is confident in his block upholding primogeniture.  Rhen assures him that he will vote in the interest of the family of course.  Sopristian makes a comment about Rhen's mother being a manipulative bitch (means it in a good way i think).

> ... Lens has always been a part of the family, and i think father agrees, wouldn't you think its time he be "naturalized"?

Sopristian is offereing that as a sweetener to hold strong with the family vote
#### _Meanwhile in the Courtyard..._
_We open this scene with someone making a soup anecdote..._
[[Lady Glorianna Morilla]] who has a truly magnetic personality makes a very delayed laugh to make a point.  She then has a private conversation with [[Tirri-Kastner]].  Mentions that [[Princess Eutropia Stavian]] has mentioned her and that she's looked forward to meeting her for a while.  They take a turn around the garden together.
[[Tirri-Kastner]] hands her a letter from [[Martella-Lotheed]]. She reads the letter and writes two quick notes.  She then asks Tirri to deliver them to [[Duke Leonard Centimus]] and [[Martella-Lotheed]].  

---

#### In the wine celler off the servant area ...
[[Arturo Basri]] finishes poisoning the wine using a syringe

---
#### In the Gallery...
[[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] Influence the room!

---

#### In the Archives...
[[Caritas Zespire]] - influences the room +1 with diplomacy roll
> Uncle!  I think i like politics! ... Oh dear .... 

[[Arturo Basri]] - makes arcana roll to influence the room adds a second +1 to our influence score for this room

---

#### Elsewhere ...
[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] see's [[Duke Panavar Lotheed]] sidle up to [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]]. They banter a little, they are clearly not friends. (annoyance and resentment) Pythareus boasts about his future and Panavar is nonplussed.

---

#### In the gallery ... 
[[Tirri-Kastner]] heads to the gallery to deliver her note to [[Martella-Lotheed]].
- Tirri successfully influences the gallery, which makes up for all the dancing she was doing earlier
- dishes with martella about [[Countess Abrielle Pace]] "that two faced bitch..."
- Martella instructs her to deliver [[Duke Leonard Centimus]]'s letter.

---
#### _We hear of the [[Grand Prince Stavian III]] arrival and head to the Arcade of Triumphs_

Servants unroll a red carpet which rolls down all 100 steps.  Murmurs and gasps are heard as their grand prince's carriage arrives, opens, and he steps out.

Twenty years have passed since our group has seen him and the years have not been kind.
The princess has an expression of shock and dismay upon seeing her father here.  (she hasn't seen him since shortly after [[Prince Carrius Stavian]]'s death).

Stavian gives Eutropia a look of utter distain and welcomes [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]]'s aid as he helps him walk down the carpet and enter into a private chamber.
