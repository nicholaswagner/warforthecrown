### The Dead Dutch

- [[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] - heads to [[Grand Duke Borund Heskillar]]'s mansion located in "Aroden's view".
- described as a happy, peacefull, but lonely feeling place
-  the curtains are drawn, dim lighting, silence is unnerving, servants appear to not be here
- [[Grand Duke Borund Heskillar]] looks exhausted, he's been beside his dead wife's bedside.  
- [[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] show's him princess eutropia's crown and tells him everything will be alright.  Eutropia gave it to her for his wife's resurrection
- ![[eutropia_tierra.jpeg]]
- He asks if the crown is stolen ... *diplomacy check* ... *secret check* his brow furrows and he says , i will take your word.
- they rush to his wife's bedside where a dwarvin cleric of (torvag, the dwarf's god) is waiting / sitting watch.  "With this many gems, surely we can save both mother and child!"
- The duke pulls [[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] over to her bedside.  "She went back for you during the senate session, she will want to see you when she wakes up".
- The cleric carefully removes the gems from the setting and grinds the stones down (almost like a morter and pestle) while softly chanting in dwarvish.
- The cleric warns everyone that this will not be pleasant to look at.  He pulls back the sheet and the body is revealed.  He pours the gems across her body and says "now we wait"...
- The three wait, the grand duke's grip grows tighter as he worries his lip.
- Her eyes flutter, "Oh Zarissa! Youre here". She notices Borund, husband! , Oh, *she touches the gash down her side* that hurts.
- Duke - "The Heskillar's are in your debt."  However did you accomplish this feat?  I sent a legion of my best men looking for gems and none were successful.
	- Z: fills the duke in on the dirty gem politics and which merosett's are involved.  She also tells him the reason his staff were not able to find gems is because they were most likely being bought off.
	- D: informs Z that there is a legend that the heskillar's are decended from bronze dragons ... and everyone knows what dragons can do when angered.
	- D pledges his loyalty to both Z and Eutropia, and says he must tend to his wife.

### The Tea Shop

### Family Feud

[[Arturo Basri]] with the fam.  
- Valentina is now in charge father, we can not take back holly vale.  Aunt Ellana has put the cart before the horse.  According to the laws of the land, primogeniture is still in effect.
- Father:  We can not give up holly vale it is the only place where your sister can be safe.  What else would we do?  Put her in danger?  All of our money is the estate!  If Elayna got it she's got it all!  I will not beg your vindictive aunt for what is OURS.
- Arturo:  We can turn this into an opportunity by embracing them in this moment.  
- Father:  I tried (when the original death happened and he inherited instead of her). She was not receptive.   We will be staying at the gilded griffen, i have already made arrangements.
- Arturo:  Ok, but i really think if we just all got into a room we could hash this out.

### The Senate Steps

Allister knocks on the door to a townhouse.  An enormous weight barrells into his crotch as Taldogus piles into his midsection.

- the princess welcomes him in.  The home is well decorated and furnished.  Her hand was clearly involved in its furnishing.  She refers to it as a sanctuary.
- I didn't expect to see you at the senate when everything happened.  Allister mentions that it was fine and they ended up below the senate.  Eutropia gives him a blank stare.  Clearly martella didn't tell me everything. 
- "Is there anything you wanted to say?"
	- I want the people to know that they are not alone and that I am not better than anybody else.  Allister: Can we speak plainly?  We ARE better than anybody else.
	- i behaved quite badly after carrious died.  That was when i spurned [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]].  I left the city.  i needed to get away from all the bullshit.  I went away to the furthest reaches and in my grief, do you know what i saw out there?  All the grief in our empire.  The ones far away from the gilded city suffering and toiling, watching their children growing ill and starving.  I felt like i had been such a foolish girl my whole life. Just a pampered, spoiled princess... all while others were cutting their bread with sand.  That's when i decided to fight for the people.
	- Allister recounts his time at the orphanage
	- princess mentions that she served as a diplomat to [[Andoran]] for a time
	- She says she's guilty of running away from the politics of glorian and Allister interrupts her and points out that she ran away from politics, but TOWARDS the plight of the people.
	- She asks for Allister's help dressing for the occassion as well.  Allister says "Whelp, we'd better look at your very large very expensive closet." "It is very big"

### The Party Meets Up

> New Trend Alert:  A new fashion trend.  Gems gems gems!  Everyone wants them, nobody has them, its the ultimate status symbol.

- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] is a little sad because now he's a little less special that everyone else has caught on to this trend

**Location: The senate floor:**
- The closer to the senate steps you are, the more gems you seem to have *observation at the steps of the senate*. 
- A full cohort of army dudes are decked out with [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]] on a warhorse at the front.  His helmet has a large plumage, and his helmet's faceplate is of an engraved lion face.  He's decked out with medals and sigils (he certainly IS the most highly decorated person in the empire).  The warhorse is wearing adamantine armor.  Its insane.
- conversation overheard in crowd by [[Arturo Basri]]:
	- The whole phalanx out huh?  I was THERE at the senate when it happened.  All I will say is this:  He KNEW something was going to happen.  I'm not saying he caused it, but he def saw it coming.
	- [[Caritas Zespire]] 's hand are trembling with fists clenched.  (He's struggling to keep himself in check.)
	- Eutropia it out and making an appearance.  She's glad-handing the crowd. At one moment she steps into the crowd to give comfort to an older woman who's crying.
		- Mark (the player) What is Eutropia wearing?  Mark describes a "quiet power outfet".  She's got a tierra fascinator.  Collerbones are popping.  Exposed collerbones feature a small spray of crystals which are a nod to the visual of a pheonix rising from the ashes.  Her hair is giving "christian girl autumn" all the time.  Kori:  Its like pinterest wedding hair.
		- Eutropia takes a flower from a little boy wearing a helmet that's too large for him.  He smiles and goes back to hug his father.
			- those with high perception checks notice that Martella slips some silver into the father's pocket. those with the perception checks infer that this was orchestrated by martella, but they don't know whether or not Eutropia would know about this.

### The Princess's Speech

The princess begins to give an impassioned and powerful speech.
- themes of shared grief and loss
- remembers specific servants who died during the massacre with names and memorable moments
- ... their labor their lives and their sacrifices will be remembered...
- *diplomacy check* - the speech seems to be well received so far, a few nobles in the front row seem a little uneasy that her speech is focusing so much on the lower class
- ... we must rise above the ashes .... we have such a bright future ahead of us...   I witnessed the future, our senate came together and voted to support overturning primogenitor ...  **diplomacy check** she throws a snipe at [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]] who gives a nod in reply.  Confirming the primogeniture was in fact passed by the senate.
- She asks that HSMP respect the last will of the fallen senate's final act
- ... we will resist the darkness ... many words will be written about the trials of recent days, but we are more than the sum of our sorrows.  We will rise stronger than before.  Those who sought to break us have only seen us prove our strength.  Lets us shine all the brighter not for ourselves, but for others who no longer can **diplomacy check** (Mark rolled a 30 for Allister)
- The crowd goes WILD.  They love their Empire, and they loved the speech!
	- Eutropia stands and waves.
	- HSMP tugs the reins of his horse and he cantors to the side.  The sound causes the entire street to go silent.  He weaves in and out as he moves between the people in the crowd. (he moves among the crowd).  He gives off "the man of the people" vibes as he begins his speech.
		- Pretty words for a pretty princess ... let me cast aside my titles as well  ... lists all of his various titles for what seems like forever. ... let me speak as a glorian.  I speak not with the soft and feminine words of grief.  My heart seeks vengence.  Our nation is mocked by other nations for our weakness.  Not so long ago the world trembled at the very mention of our name.  Even now the Caderons make assalts on Zimar.  And I leave shortly to lead our army to defend the city.   The princess speaks as a women and with the words of a mother for a child ... 
		- He gives an empassioned speech for following the ways of old, the ways that built this empire, of strength, and of power.  That the other nations should tremble once again.  That their enemies should fear us.  I speak as a soldier.  I know the value of every man and yes, woman as well, knowing their place.
		- he speaks of traditions that have lasted for centuries, how we have become weak and our enemies have taken advantage of that weakness.
		- So i ask you my fellow glorians, what future do you desire? one of strength and order or one of slow decay where soft hands and soft hearts lead us to ignoble death.  Consider carefully.
		- He ends the speech at the foot of the steps with him sitting on his horse looking down at the princess
	- He exchanges some words with the the princess but it is very soft and only for each other to hear.
		- Zarissa reads lips and reads:  
			  "Truly I am sorry for your loss."  "I think you are the first person who has said that to me. He was a complicated man, but I know he was like a father to you as well."
		- Tirri - looks around and see's that the nobles are not really showing favor to either person in an attempt to be politically smart
		- Allister:  "attempts to sow a rumor" - "The HS is taking your power - the nobles"
		- Uncle Orlundo - is always near the princess, basically just making sure she stays alive
		- Valentina is practically draped on a man who she's with.  He has a very VERY soft face. He cheers when [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]] finishes his speech.
		- Arturo leans over to her and says she's going to need to pick a side.  "I already know who'se side i'm on ... mine!"  Arturo lets her know they will be at the basillica of the last man.  She ignores him and is bedecked with jewels. (got that new money fashion)
		- Caritas congratulates Allister on the speech and they and Arturo rag on HS for a few moments.
		- [[Martella-Lotheed]] congratulates [[Tribune Ser Allister Hound]] on the speech, and says he's quite a compelling writer.  It was an excellent and empowering opening salvo.
			- a war council will need to be scheduled for later this week

The party moves into downtime ...

- [[Tirri-Kastner]] - retrains a feat ( i believe )
- [[Caritas Zespire]] - competes in duels all week, earns 14 gold and then notices a rumor going around town. The rumor is that [[Lord Vael]] has said that he came quickly and has a tiny dick.
- [[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] - does some spell training 
- [[Tribune Ser Allister Hound]] - action house - betney estate, [[Lady Glorianna Morilla]] starts waving the paddle and goes to town, betting gets really high, at one point she doubles down on the current bid price 40,000gp (as an example).  
	- Oh allister, i didn't realize you'd be here today. I heard that you played a defining role in the speech that Eutropia delivered.  I think the princess is very grateful, I think we all are.
	- Hound ... its Andoren isn't it?  Your parents were Andoran then?  I've have a suspicion that you weren't a natural born Clement.  Are your parents dead?
	- Morilla:  I like you, and I think the princess likes you, and soon I think you will learn how much.  She takes her deed to the betney estate and leaves.
		- As she left she handed Allistere an origami bird that participated in the auction.  Allister looks to see what the note was, and sees the handwriting ... its eutropia's.  She gave morilla an order to go from 20k to 40k on the bid.
	- Allister remembers that The Betney estate was the neighboring estate to [[The Palace of Birdsong]].
