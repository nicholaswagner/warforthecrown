#### Nighttime, the party arrives at the warehouse, several guards are outside.  (not halflings). We witness the changing of the guards.  Three guards are on duty while three walk thr

A figure beside us darts by and a sliver of white hair is seen as they whoosh by.  They step up to the door very quickly and start to fumble with the lock.

(We recognize the face of the elf woman who approached outside the senate building)
She ducks back into the shadows and is chased by three guards. Three more take their places, close the doors and bolt it from behind.

The party moves into an exploration phase. [[Arturo Basri]] sneaks around and scouts out the building.

The party watches the guards patrolling around the warehouse...

> Ahhhhh... .much oblidged .... I've been hiding here for hours and hours ....  - box boi

Allister and the box boi speak for a few minutes.  "Afarni" offers him some wine.
He offers him wine and Caritas recognizes the wine / bottle.

Short version:  It was from the very bad year for the zespires.  The family vinyards almost went under.  They didn't because someone bought up crates and crates of their absolutely god awful wine that they barely managed to produce the year after his father's death and when their vineyards were ravaged.  It appears that the princess interceeded on our behalf. :tear:

[[Tribune Ser Allister Hound]] and Affarni share around some of the wine.

[[Arturo Basri]] sends a message to [[Martella-Lotheed]] "We have entered the warehouse, make some noise if you can!"

#### Rhenquist leads the way through a door ... piles and piles and piles of crates, with a metal box suspended halfway up the wall which overlooks the floor.  A huge pair of 5ft metal pipes extends up from the floor towards the office.
R spots a table with six chairs around it.  A game of cards has been abandoned, along with six cups that are just left here.

The party feels a looming sense of paranoia. 40ft high ceilings, with narrow pathways through the crates.  

> ... And there are more waiting for you here ....  *thunk.  a bolt strikes into a crate near the party as we hear a bunch of footsteps
