## Exploring the Safehouse & Uncovering a Threat 

The session began with the party investigating a hidden entrance to the sewer system, stumbling upon a chamber filled with creeping fungal growth. Some useful items were recovered before they pressed on, eventually discovering a large war table covered with maps of the Glorian Empire’s prefectures.

Their exploration was interrupted by an unsettling sight— a small, lone girl. Before anyone could react, Arturo struck preemptively, revealing the girl’s horrifying true form: a porcelain arachnid construct, a nightmarish servant of Thanier Gigs, the Halfway God of Assassins. A brutal combat ensued, and after shattering the creature into shards, the party barely had a moment to breathe before something far worse occurred.

## A Mark of Divine Wrath

As silence settled over the room, Arturo was suddenly lifted off his feet and slammed onto the table by an unseen force. He convulsed, his eyes rolling back as a spectral figure straddled him, carving a wicked symbol into his face with a razor-thin blade. Though the pain was excruciating, when the vision passed, the mark faded—leaving behind a chilling realization. Arturo had been branded by Thanier Gigs, marking him as reviled by the god’s followers. This curse, known as the Brand of Impenitence, would now be visible to those who served the Halfway God, making him a target for assassins.

Shaken but determined, the party resolved to push forward, knowing that hesitation could spell their doom.

## Into the Cultist’s Den

Following a tense moment of regrouping, the adventurers pressed on, discovering a long hallway lined with open doors leading to small bedchambers. At the far end, a group of cultists was deep in conversation, discussing the Brotherhood of Silence’s potential plans to claim the hideout for themselves.

Using stealth and tactical positioning, the party seized the opportunity for an ambush. A deadly battle erupted, with Zarissa unleashing a devastating Inner Radiance Torrent, blasting through the cultists in a storm of radiant energy. Rehnquist, Caritas, and Arturo engaged in close combat, while Alastair supported with inspiring magic. One by one, the cultists fell, leaving only a single survivor who was swiftly subdued.

Before deciding whether to interrogate their captive, Arturo grimly reminded the party that these were not mere thugs, but dedicated assassins who would rather die than betray their god.

## Martella’s Room & A Deadly Trap

Continuing their search for Martella, the party discovered a lavishly decorated chamber—undoubtedly belonging to her. Among the fine furnishings, they found Kellish-styled garments, mechanical schematics, and enchanted objects: a delicate purple rose, a strange empty sack, and an alabaster mask.

Caritas, ever the bold one, reached for the sack—only to trigger an elaborate mechanical trap. The desk burst to life in a chain reaction of intricate clockwork, culminating in a vial of Insanity Mist shattering and releasing a mind-warping gas. Several party members succumbed to its effects, their thoughts clouded by intrusive paranoia, existential dread, or strange moments of clarity.

Meanwhile, Alastair, drawn to the ornate mask, placed it over his face—only to find that every time his allies glanced away, their eyes were inexorably drawn back to him.
  
With Martella still missing and the dangers mounting, the party braced themselves for what lay ahead...
