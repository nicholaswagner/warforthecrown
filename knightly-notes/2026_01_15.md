# Downtime Results

[[Allister Hound]] - runs his fundraiser for the stachys market, get an unhelpful 5sp donation from [[Titus Casava-Lotheed]].

[[Arturo Basri]] attempts to help:  He manages to shave a day off the build.  Success!

[[Caritas Zespire]]  attempts to locate a historical relic to give to [[baroness Voynam]], its fake, he sends, she responds to his letter with a very bland and generic "thank you" that probably was written by a secretary, not even her.

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] hears some useful rumors:
- nightswan began their activities when [[Count Bartleby Lotheed]] took over at [[Lothidar]]
- there is a run on the fashion that comes from "Soto", wolf pelts were all the rage, but now there is a higher demand and the supplies are low.  The people of Soto are also trying to buy goats for some reason.  lots of goats.

[[Arturo Basri]] receives a letter from [[Marquess Tanasha Starborne]] concerning the druid. (in response to a letter he was inquiring about her).
- the druid we have "prisoner" is ... potentially ... very ... very ... very old.  Much older than we thought.  She was around when the original treaty with the druids was signed perhaps.
- she IS the sort of woman who wins arguments and is a political time bomb
- she is impossible to deceive
- the lodge does not wish "peace" it wishes for "balance"
-

## the following morning

[[Allister Hound]]:
upon waking, Allister discovers a letter from the [[Nightswan]] threatening him, calling him piggish and tells him to leave or "their next message will come on a spear's point"

[[Zarissa Nocturne]]:
speaks with the resident domovoi of the house.
- did you see anyone ? ( related to Allister's threatening letter).  No, but we sensed someone.
- would you sense them if you noticed them again?  Yes ... perhaps.
- Z asks them to alert Her, [[Rhenquist-Merosett]], or [[Arturo Basri]] if they detect someone new

_Zarissa has now created the absolute worst home alarm ever_.

[[Wanderer Gayland Thorn]] arrives at the house and the domovoi (in cat forms) begin screaming at [[Zarissa Nocturne]], [[Arturo Basri]], and [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]

Greetings are exchanged, and Allister whispers for [[Tirri-Kastner]] to ask her about the Druid.

Tirri takes WGT for a walk around the grounds.  During their walk they have a conversation.
- they make conversation about the grounds
- WGT asks how she's enjoyed being on the wandering path again.
- Tirri asks her for advice and tells her about our party's recent encounter with the undead.
- WGT:  If this was a curse from an arch litch, then I could not really help... maybe i could do something temporarily... but its very difficult and not something you could easily cast on your own.  Its quite advanced ... i'm not sure you're ready for it.   There is a way to draw power from dreams.  You can use it to reach for magic that would ordinarily be beyond your grasp.  Think of it as wells of Elodin's power which you can draw upon.  But you would need a willing dreamer from which you could draw their power.   Rituals like this can draw from the power of multiple people.  
- WGT:  We should attempt the ritual before the spirit re-constitutes. (before the next full moon). If you succeed at this ritual, it will prove that you are much stronger than I think you are at this point.
- WGT: will go gather the materials required to perform the ritual and will be back before the full moon. (aka the market opening / druid trial / cursed dead rising day)

## Conversation about The undead problem
The party discusses the day of the trial, and Caritas brings up the undead problem.. (aka this cursed historical figure is going to rise from the dead and start killing the town)
- [[Tirri-Kastner]] mentions that she can perform a ritual that could buy us time and prevent this from happening until the next full moon.
- she will utilize a willing dreamer (or more than one)

# Zarissa and Anllel Oakleaf 
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] and [[Anllel Oakleaf]] take a walk around the grounds and speak
- Z tells her they received a letter from [[Marquess Tanasha Starborne]] who mentioned Oakleaf and Z said it sounds like she's been around quite a long time.  Z asks why she left the lodge.
- Oak insists that she see the letter.  [[Arturo Basri]] holds back the senate related pages but releases the Starborne files.
- Oak: "You lot aren't going to kill me are you? {sounding disappointed}"
- Oak tells Z that's she's dying and reminisces about how this place used to be with wood nymph's in the saplings of the trees.  They were playful. (some are standoffish, but these werent).
- When trees die, the nymphs die with them, and when the woodcutters came the nymphs were still young.  I think of how they must have felt as they died.  I was against the treaty, but I wasn't an arch druid then.  Once the Glorian Empire decides they want something and it belongs to them, it gets what it wants.  The unicorns were banished, and beautiful things about the land were demolished so the empire could expand and continue the cycle of destruction against nature.  Now i am old and this felt like it would be my final opportunity to make a difference.
- The gnome has a big mouth, but she's the most decent thing the empire has, and i won't speak ill of her.
- She reveals that her plan was to cause war between the lodge and the empire.
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] suggests that perhaps a grove could be planted on the grounds... she acknowledges that it wouldn't fix the past, but it could be a new beginning.
- Oak asks how Z can stand with these people.  Z says that her friends are different.

## Rhen trails Port
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] keeps tabs on [[Portimer Salus]] throughout the day
- R overhears that Portimer and [[Juna Salus]] talk about looking forward to the trial (in the sense that they are ready for this to be over with)
- Port goes to [[wolfs whisker]], while there Rhen observes some of the men reveal that they have been having nightmares of a witch charming the men and having them do terrible things.  example: "eating their children etc", they believe its because "the witch is nearby" and they are ready for this witch to be gone so they can be free of these nightmares.
- Port does not go home from the [[wolfs whisker]] instead he goes to the woods and pulls out a bunch of flowers (dandelions) that he places down on a stone and then leaves
- Rhen investigates the scene and sees that the stone sits atop a mound of earth.

## Allister and Caritas visit with [[Marjorine Gagrus]]
- [[Allister Hound]] reminds Marj about her time with Goul Fever.  And she mentions how grateful she was and that she's only alive because of him.
- Allister tells her that she's about to hear something she might not like, but he tells her that the arch druid wasn't the one who made her sick and during the conversation the fact that the druid is under house arrest at our house came to light.
- Marj is fully and stubbornly of the opinion that the Druid is a witch and now believes that she has charmed he and I.
- the two men leave the house depressed and frustrated as the situation now feels worse than before.

## There is a knock at the door
Its [[Onora Piscum]] who tells us that there's a disturbance in the town and some hellnights are demanding to see the tribune.

The party suits up and heads over.

A woman with scares on head and face [[Paralictor Seraxa Threx]] makes some demands for their their people. (about 14).  stabling for 8 horses.

[[Allister Hound]] invites them to be his guests at the house and pulls the [[Paralictor Seraxa Threx]] aside.  
- as an adjudicator of justice, would you be willing to be an advisor to the town
- he explains the situation
- she suggests a "trial by torment"
- she is ... difficult
