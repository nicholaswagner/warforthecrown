The night of the eighth of Rova
___

The party gets up early as they will be riding to [[Voinaris]] 
[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] awakens to a wet feeling near his feet. 
- A cat shifts into its domovoi form. 
- "There's something you should see ... something we've decided you are worthy of seeing"
- "Aren't you sure you don't want Arturo?"  "Arturo is equally worthy ... you should wake up your other companions"
- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] ties back his hair, throws on a night robe and heads out to wake up the party.  As he gets up he sees mushrooms beginning to sprout up from the floorboards.
- R: grabs a small dagger from beside his bed, slips it into a pocket and begins to follow the mushrooms out the doors.

The rest of the party is awoken by the house domovoi.  ![[Nodd]]  ![[Wink]]
![[Blunk]]


---

The party follows the mushroom traiil out to the grounds where there are a bunch of vivid mushrooms growing up from the grounds and the three D's sit.

### The clouds break
The clouds open and a shaft of moon light slices through the night and lands on a basket hilted sword with a series of gems in the handle.

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] realizes it is Coriana's blade.  The blade that was lost to history.

The three D's heard our stories and thought we were worthy of the blade.
They hid it and it was made to protect this land.  But it has been some time since it has had protectors.

Alice was the peaceful sort.  

Malonarin and Rue-Leaf speak of something dark descending upon this place.
The swan princess mourns in advance.
The whispering tyrant was a mega-lich.  [[Tar-baphon]].
The last great thing the Glorian Empire did was put them down.

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] reaches for the blade and one of the cats jumps on top of its hilt.
- he sees a leather satchel hanging from the hilt
- "This blade was forged to protect if you are not worthy, we will take it back."
-  [[Caritas Zespire]] walks up and squats next to the blade, holding his sheet that's covering his naked frame
- R opens the leather satchel and discovers three books written in common
	- (will need to devote downtime to reading each book, very archiac). each "coriana sendaris" , "tandric sendaris", and "coriana sendaris" (second name is a repeat).

---

### The four treasures discovered so far
The party has now discovered four national treasures: Dignitys barb, Envoy's ring, Godspike, and Coriana's Blade.

---

### The horses are prepared for our ride
Servants will not be able to attend us.
[[Arturo Basri]] begins to sing...

The party stops to break their face at Lockland Lake.  A shimmering thick silver mist.
Eating hard boiled eggs, catfish jerky, etc.
a flock of swans is taking off across the surface of the lake, horses or unicorns off in the distance...

---

### Several hours later
We pass [[Lothidar]], and stop by stathian for a picnic lunch.


Conversation:  Note for later:
> R: make a decision Caritas

> Allister - how do you identify ... Glorian first or Andoran first?

---

### The secret life of Allister Hound

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] brings up [[Lucien Alcier]] and asks if L would consider [[Allister Hound]] would be considered "loyal".  

> Sorry I'll give you your pot back later Z I'm busy stirring - [[Allister Hound]]


---

### Vinyards
The smell of wine ...

R - i've asked my fam to come and stay with us for a while.
Arturo - asks if Lens will make any power plays with R away.

---

### Along the way
> conversation about [[Caritas Zespire]] 's motivations

---
### Approaching the city gates

[[Voinaris]] sits on a hill.  Lothidar is "perfection", lawns manicured, etc etc.  Voinaris is different.  The town is surrounded by and impressive wall of dark gray stone.  (town of a few hundred).  13 towers crenelated.  The gate tower is equipped with seige weaponry (large ballista). clean beautiful maintained.

Carts are coming in (merchants cart) -
 armor is practical, well maintained with military care.

Wine and Vinegar smells.

[[Baroness Adella Voinum]]'s estate. "Iron Vine Hall".
Merchants are coming in with fabrics, banners, flags, the makings of carts and tents.

**check** society roll:  

---
### Market's Door
Abadar Holiday:  "Market's Door" based on when their harvest happens.
Basically a harvest day festival.  The village is in the prep phase of this event.

BV: commands the finest fighting force in MC.
Eventually the children of stachys are sent to Voinarus for military training

---


".. come out of what?" [[Baroness Adella Voinum]]
- she introduces her 2 people with her (missed the names). Stephen and Ellenor. (both commoners)
** roll** Critical perception roll: she's a bit tipsy:  (rolled a nat 20 +9)

> What brought you to moost?

Dame Crabb has invited you huh?
Voin - extends an invitation to their market door celebration on 2nd of Lamishan
The counts invitation must have been lost in the mail.
Arturo asks about their good friend Moffet, and she mentions that they are just over in Soto.

The Vallar and Vine Inn:
- 1 gp for a room with two beds
- dinner is venison

Society roll:  No reason this inn should be serving venison to us. Venison is very opulent food. Anyone caught poaching venison are severely punished.  The "Void wood" is next door... but that should be permitted by the Count in Lothidoor.

This rule would be enforced by voinum .. looks like it might not be.

During dinner:  [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]  just keeps eating and eating.... suddenly he stops and runs for the privvy.  He's explosively vomiting.

[[Allister Hound]] gets up and checks on him.
Cute scene where Allister knocks on the privvy door and asks if its coming out the front or the back...
- R says front and groans
- A asks if he can come in
- A looks at him and recognizes that R is suffering from [[Ghoul Fever]]
- A closes the door and tells R

The rest of the party is still drinking and carousing in the main hall.

Rooms are decided.  A, R, and T are together in a room.
- TK casts [[Cleanse Affliction]] on R



[[Allister Hound]] slips out and heads to [[Baroness Adella Voinum]]'s mansion (the iron something)
- a man with a sword answers the door. "can i help you"?
- Allister requests an audience with the Baroness?  He mentions he's the Tribune of Stachys and its an emergency.
- Flashback:  Allister picked up some of the wine that BAV was drinking as he left the tavern / inn

BAV sees him, offers him tea which he declines, then offers him Whiskey, which he accepts with gusto.

> What emergency has befallen the Tribune of Stachys that he would visit me in the dark of night?

>I bring an ill omen, and ask for your help and advice, we thought we had this handled, but it turns out that R has picked up ghoul fever and started showing symptoms tonight.  

"You think its contagious?"  "If it progresses".
V doesn't know anything about ghoul fever.  she asks if it will spread and are the people are in danger.

V: "I don't keep a cleric on staff, and I know every person here in V.. none of them would be up to the task.  You can turn back and visit the archbanker, i'm sure she could handle this.  Do you need the money for it?"  Allister:  No, but I'd ask your advice.  Would it be worse to go to moost potentially carrying the fever, or to be late to the event with Dame Crabbe?

"How long till it becomes contagious?"  "If it were me and it was someone I care about, I wouldn't take any chances".  If you leave early enough we can make it to moost by early morning.  I'm not the baroness of the barony there, but i'll give you a writ.  It might help grant you an audience.  

"I see you brought wine" ... Allister:  I was told never to show up empty handed.

"She keeps the bottles"

[[Baroness Adella Voinum]]'s attitude points are increased by `1` but her attitude remains `indifferent` at this time

---

### Allister returns
A knocks on his room door, remembers that its his room and opens it with his key

conversation about R's health.

R carries Arturo off to his room, everyone sleeps

### The party arrives in Moost
[[Moost]] is a small hamlet which forms a crescent around the foot of the road which is capped at the top of a hill "The Crabb Estate"

-  Rhenquist gets healed - the party cashes in the letter from V to do it and pays 30gp
---

### Party arrives at the Crabbe Residence
stairs leading up to large wooden doors on a white washed mansion exterior
- eastern portion of main building has a four story high tower
- western face has large collection of hedges / topiaries and a sprawling hedge-maze
- as we dismount from our horses the wide doors dramatically open and Dame Crabbe is there in a pink dress with a full band that includes strings and a magical explosion of fireworks goes off which welcomes us to the crabb residence.
- DC - holds an impressive curtsy the entire time we walk up to her position at the top
- Sepsinia is lurking in the shadows - her dress is gray and she seems to be hiding
- she invites us in and offers us food

- The party discovers a stack of the Wilted Rose
