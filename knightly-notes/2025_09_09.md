Our scene opens with the party in a rowboat in the swamps near stachys.  They have just left [[the lurker]] and heard screams coming from the pump house.

[[Zarissa Nocturne]]'s ring begins to vibrate and glow as some creatures begin to emerge from the pump house

The party with advanced warning draws their weapons.

[[Allister Hound]] begins to chant ... "dont die, dont die, dont die, dont die ... ", and the party members begin to feel the effects of rallying anthem.

[[Tirri-Kastner]] raises her shield to block any attacks

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] notices that the six figures before us are (ghasts)[https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=219]
- Rhen chucks a [[Ghost Charges]]  to the nearest ghast

[[Tirri-Kastner]] - casts [[Infuse Vitality]] via a casting of little glowing stars  on rhen, carit, and arturo else
- weapon strikes will now do 2d4 additional _vitality_ damage

[[Arturo Basri]] -
	- devizes a stratagem *crits* 
		- weakest save is fortitude
		- notable abilities - they can consume flesh to regain health points
	- fires a crossbow bolt at nearby ghast
	- shields up

Blue - moves in and attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] 
	- it slashes Rhen and then quickly ducks sideways and leaps back out into the dark and we hear a splash in the water

[[Caritas Zespire]] - readied action, sword parry
- will attack a creature if it comes into melee range

Red - rocks the boat - everyone holds on successfully

[[Allister Hound]]
- sustains his [[Rallying Cry]]
- strikes his [[Dread Marshal Stance]]
- Cries out a witty [[Bon Mot]] at the red ghast as it attempts to rock the boat
	- > Is that the best you can do?

Yellow Ghast: sneaks up behind caritas
- Provenence tells Carit to check his six
- caritas *crits*: spins around and one shots the ghast. ( prov does nonlethal damage so its knocked unconscious)

[[Zarissa Nocturne]] 
- [[Needle of Vengeance]] - marks [[Caritas Zespire]] as the target and casts it on the green ghast
- green dies and several seconds later churning in the water is spotted as we suspect that [[the lurker]] is feasting

Pink Ghast
- attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] but misses

Orange Ghast
- grapples [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] and pulls him out of the boat and drags him into the water
- a splash is heard in the dark and ripples appear as some sort of struggle is happening under the water

---
Another scream is heard from the pump house and a golden light shines across the water as a figure emerges from the pump house.
- large swollen tongue down to their chest
- waterlogged robes of blue and green
- shining on its chest is a holy symbol of arasmene *spelling is probably wrong*
- braided hair that floats up as if it was under water
- in its hand is a glowing spear which we can see even from this distance the hand is blistering and burning from the contact with it
- The queen with out a face
She jumps into the boat and thrusts her spear at [[Caritas Zespire]], who dodges aside

---

- She retaliates:  "The queen" strikes with her spear and it strikes [[Arturo Basri]]

- A swaps out for his shortsword

Blue:
- attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] who nimble dodges away
- attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] again who takes 6 slashing dmg

[[Caritas Zespire]]
- intimidating strikes the pink ghoul next to him who is now afeared
- continues to parry attacks

Red: 
- attacks [[Rhen]] for 6 reduced to 4 piercing dmg and paralyzes [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]

[[Allister Hound]]
