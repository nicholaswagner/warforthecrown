### Encounter in the Swamp
Our scene opens with the party in a rowboat in the swamps near stachys.  They have just left [[the lurker]] and heard screams coming from the pump house.

[[Zarissa Nocturne]]'s ring begins to vibrate and glow as some creatures begin to emerge from the pump house

The party with advanced warning draws their weapons.
---

[[Allister Hound]] begins to chant ... "dont die, dont die, dont die, dont die ... ", and the party members begin to feel the effects of rallying anthem.

[[Tirri-Kastner]] raises her shield to block any attacks

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] notices that the six figures before us are (ghasts)[https://2e.aonprd.com/Monsters.aspx?ID=219]
- Rhen chucks a [[Ghost Charges]]  to the nearest ghast

[[Tirri-Kastner]] - casts [[Infuse Vitality]] via a casting of little glowing stars  on rhen, carit, and arturo else
- weapon strikes will now do 2d4 additional _vitality_ damage

[[Arturo Basri]] -
	- devizes a stratagem *crits* 
		- weakest save is fortitude
		- notable abilities - they can consume flesh to regain health points
	- fires a crossbow bolt at nearby ghast
	- shields up

Blue - moves in and attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] 
	- it slashes Rhen and then quickly ducks sideways and leaps back out into the dark and we hear a splash in the water

[[Caritas Zespire]] - readied action, sword parry
- will attack a creature if it comes into melee range

Red - rocks the boat - everyone holds on successfully

[[Allister Hound]]
- sustains his [[Rallying Cry]]
- strikes his [[Dread Marshal Stance]]
- Cries out a witty [[Bon Mot]] at the red ghast as it attempts to rock the boat
	- > Is that the best you can do?

Yellow Ghast: sneaks up behind caritas
- Provenence tells Carit to check his six
- caritas *crits*: spins around and one shots the ghast. ( prov does nonlethal damage so its knocked unconscious)

[[Zarissa Nocturne]] 
- [[Needle of Vengeance]] - marks [[Caritas Zespire]] as the target and casts it on the green ghast
- green dies and several seconds later churning in the water is spotted as we suspect that [[the lurker]] is feasting

Pink Ghast
- attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] but misses

Orange Ghast
- grapples [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] and pulls him out of the boat and drags him into the water
- a splash is heard in the dark and ripples appear as some sort of struggle is happening under the water

---
### Another scream is heard from the pump house and a golden light shines across the water as a figure emerges from the pump house.

- large swollen tongue down to their chest
- waterlogged robes of blue and green
- shining on its chest is a holy symbol of arasmene *spelling is probably wrong*
- braided hair that floats up as if it was under water
- in its hand is a glowing spear which we can see even from this distance the hand is blistering and burning from the contact with it
- The queen with out a face
She jumps into the boat and thrusts her spear at [[Caritas Zespire]], who dodges aside

---

- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]
	- breaks free and swims to the surface where he "little mermaids" and shakes out his blond hair

[[Tirri-Kastner]]
- [[Inner Radiance Torrent]] heightened +1 
	- 16points of force +1 from [[Allister Hound]]'s rally
	- "emperer palpatine vibes as the casting visual"

[[Arturo Basri]]
	- 14 piercing + 5 vitality dmg as he fires his crossbow at "the queen"

- She retaliates:  "The queen" strikes with her spear and it strikes [[Arturo Basri]]

- A swaps out for his shortsword

Blue:
- attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] who nimble dodges away
- attacks [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] again who takes 6 slashing dmg

[[Caritas Zespire]]
- intimidating strikes the pink ghoul next to him who is now afeared
- continues to parry attacks

Red: 
- attacks [[Rhen]] for 6 reduced to 4 piercing dmg and paralyzes [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]

[[Allister Hound]]
- sustains his [[pathfinder2e/Spells/Rallying Anthem|Rallying Anthem]]
- slows the queen who loses 1 action for this next round

[[Zarissa Nocturne]] casts [[Concordant Choir]]
- sonic AOE damage hits everything in range
- screams evanescence lyrics

[[Periwinkle]] attacks the red ghast and and chews his face to death

Orange ghast:
- attacks Rhenquest under the water again who is paralyzed

---

The queen attacks [[Arturo Basri]]
- she thrusts with Godspite (her spear probably)
- there is a clear internal struggle on her non face where she appears to be trying to hold herself back
- attempts more attacks on Arturo, but all fail this time

---
[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] 

[[Tirri-Kastner]] - casts a huge AOE healing spell
- allies get healed
- enemies get hurt
- this is a big deal

[[Arturo Basri]]
- devises a stratagem and casts [[Ignition]] on the queen
- "I'm sorry Marjorine" and he stabs with his shortsword + its magically imbued ignition spell

She dies ... again.

---

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] pops up from the water

> I knew it!  I knew it was going to be undead!

The party ties the body to the back of the ship and drags it behind them as they continue towards the pump house.

Rhenquist identifies her spear as "Godspite" a relic of Glorian History

---

[[Tirri-Kastner]] applies some holy oil to her that will keep her from coming back for **24 hours**

---

### The party heads to the pumphouse

There is a shield half buried in the ground
- its a [[Spellguard Shield]], level 6 item and worth a chunk of 250g
- an engraved silver compact worth 45s
- platinum and diamond necklace worth 30g
- loose cash worth 20g 186s 330c

The party arrives at the pumphouse.  rotted machinery, stagnant water, the machinery was designed so that animals would power the machinery, notably we discover a coffin inside.
painted symbols on the wall that [[Arturo Basri]] identifies as the god Arasne.  The coffin is completely destroyed by water and time.  There were intentional carvings and etchings in a language that none of the party can recognize.  It appears that someone attempted to turn this into a sanctuary of sorts.

The party suspects that this is Marjorine Sandaris's sanctuary.  She perhaps moved herself and her coffin here and tried to make it a holy place.  We discover a water logged paper on the ground next to the coffin.

> **The confessions of Marjorine Sandaris** ( paraphrased ... badly)
> I set my hand to this chronicle ...
> Grievous was the wound I took on ...
> Though i died, death was not the end ... I rose hungry sharp as razers for the flesh of my own kin.  3 of my own i slayed.  I was killed and rose again and from tomb unsealed i lay waste to my own blood again until destroyed again by fire.  I was laid to rest again with Godspike my holy spear.  Time passed and destroyed the holy bindings that held me.  I awoke again and felt the blood of the sandaris near.  When first i clawed myself free from the crypt, Godspite burning me again.  ... 


[[Zarissa Nocturne]] points out that the next new moon should appear in about a week and according to her note, it seems that she will regain her mental faculties at that time.

---

### The party discusses some different options.

[[Arturo Basri]] wants to bring the body back to swanmere and throw it in the dungeons till we can figure out what to do with it

[[Caritas Zespire]] wants to bring this body to the [[Archbanker Lady Paril]] and time it so that if she doesn't necessarily want to help, she might _have to whether she likes it or not_

[[Arturo Basri]] points out that Marjorine is a Local history figure and the town will care about her

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] points out a few options we have

---

The party returns and leaves the barge where we found it.

---
### Leave a light on

We arrive back at swanmere around 2am and there are lights on in the windows of the smoking room.

Two figures are sitting on the sofas.  

Its [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]'s family!!

![[rhen_and_lens_and_irrisen.png]]

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] runs up and throws his arms around his family.  [[Lens Hill Merosett]] and [[Verlin Merosett]].

> No one fucks in Arturo's bed - [[Lens Hill Merosett]]

A giant chest is sitting next to the sofa.  [[Verlin Merosett]] is a little weirded out by [[Anllel Oakleaf]]. 

Verlin warns us that the portents point to there being a trap here.

Lense and Rhenquist speak quietly outside:
- Martella found that the lot of us are descended of / connected to the palace of swanmere and is making a diplomatic play to establish this as a seat of power
- > i am so happy you two are here - Rhenquist

The count paid for us to be teleported here, but it came with a price.. he asked us to deliver a letter to you.

---
### Allister heads to his room for the night

As he approaches the room he opens the door very slowly ... 
- there are dozens of pidgins
- " you think you're clever huh?  did you make yourself at home?"
- He and [[Anllel Oakleaf]] trade barbs back and forth
- A admits that oakleaf probably didn't cause the outbreak but both people continue to trade barbs
- A:  "I DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU, I CARE ABOUT WHATS BEST FOR STACHYS AND STACHYS WANTS TO BURN YOU ALIVE.  I'M TRYING TO KEEP THEM FROM DOING THAT"

---
### Meanwhile in [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]'s room
> What do you mean an Arch Druid was captured? - [[Verlin Merosett]]

... The Sheriff of a town made of ... mud ... captured an ARCH druid?!!!
[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] continues to explain the situation.

[[Lens Hill Merosett]] **balancing an orange on his nose** Are you telling me that an ARCH druid could be held against their will if she didn't want to be here? 

---
### Tribune and Arch Druid
[[Anllel Oakleaf]] sarcastically apologizes for not treating him with the deference that his station deserved.

[[Allister Hound]] asks her to turn into a pidgen. She refuses.

[[Allister Hound]] asks her to remain in the dungeon area for now

---

### Rhenquist and fam
You could write [[Marquess Tanasha Starborne]] and seek her help?  - [[Verlin Merosett]]
R offers whatever he can to make their stay more comfortable etc.
L asks how much "bowing and scraping" R thinks that Allister expects.
R: tells L that ever since [[Anllel Oakleaf]] arrived, Allister has been overreacting to everything.
L:  "I didn't know that Allister was the one in charge here.  His decision to leave has DESTROYED Lucian.  I think I'm supposed to act like everything's fine ... but everything is NOT FINE."
L:  I mean I know i'm a bastard but i'm still a Merosette... he's not even a Glorian!
V: says its time for everyone to go to bed.
