The guests of [[Count Bartleby Lotheed]] are watching him perform a "fireworks display" in the gardens perfectly choreographed to beautiful music performed by [[Eldrin Vale]] / his performers.
Shortly after the party sees a play performed by a halfling troop.  This time the tone is "serious performers performing a serious play".

### The party watches a brief performance
- [[Dame Parthena Crabbe]] after a few drinks performs a traditional dance (and she does it with a stunning amount of grace and skill!)
	- [[Caritas Zespire]] looks to see her daughter's reaction and notices that Sepsinia is not in the crowd.
	- [[Allister Hound]] *performance check:: critical success:* 
		- he hypes up the crowd
		- gives an impassioned speech that includes some insights towards the differences between [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]] and [[Princess Eutropia Stavian]] (leaning towards Eutropia)
	- [[Tirri-Kastner]] performance check
		- [[Dame Parthena Crabbe]] and [[Baron-Nicolaus-Okerra]] are enthralled at her performance

### Social checks
-  [[Arturo Basri]] speaks with [[Dame Carodd Hellebore]]  ... pirate hat lady i think?
		- she's unfriendly in her responses .. Arturo negs her and walks away
		- She moves from unfriendly to indifferent.
- [[Allister Hound]] speaks with [[Count Bartleby Lotheed]]
		- **rolls a really great diplomacy check**
		- the count was nervous about hosting this first tanniger jamboree
		- Allister can "twist" all kinds of things ... (the count laughs)
		- the count mentions that he had heard rumors of the manticore, but hadn't taken them seriously. He expresses some shame / disappointment over the mistake
		- Bartleby invites [[Allister Hound]] to visit the [[The Palace of Birdsong]] any time he wishes, allister says that he'll be making sure that Bartleby is here
- [[Zarissa Nocturne]] speaks with [[Archbanker Lady Paril]] who is dressed with "Fox" motifs
	- Z inquires about [[Sepsinia Crabbe]]
		- "Its just awful what happened to her!"
		- [[Dame Parthena Crabbe]] had arranged a wonderful match for her, but her fiance  killed himself ([[Opilio]]).
			- curiously, [[Sepsinia Crabbe]] seemed to take it all in stride for a time, but now [[Dame Parthena Crabbe]] has confided in her that she seems to be depressed now.  She is withdrawn, she stopped painting, and where she was once lively like [[Selly Okerra]], now she is depressed.
- [[Caritas Zespire]] speaks with [[Eldrin Vale]]
	- It goes well, [[Caritas Zespire]] expresses a moment of genuine vulnerability and it resonates with Vale.
	- Vale lets his guard down a bit and they get to know each other a bit
	- C extends an invitation to E to consider performing in Stackies at some point
	- C asks if V will meet [[Allista Cragus aka Purple Finch]] as a personal favor to him.
		- V agrees in exchange for a favor in kind and the two shake on it.
- [[Eldrin Vale]] on his way back from is break
	- he speaks with [[Tirri-Kastner]].
		- they trade polite barbs
		- TK slips in a particularly nasty barb about how he is "paid to be there"
-  [[Baroness Adella Voinum]] speaks with [[Tirri-Kastner]]
	- Voinum enjoyed TK's performance
	- Voinum voices some insights into TK's religious views / worship that TK finds valuable
	- TK succeeds on an influence check, it doesn't raise her current attitude towards the party,  but its another success on the road to that.
