#### The dignified repository part two
---
The party fought their way inside the repo, met [[Afarni]], and made it into the second area...

As the encounter begins, the three players who imbibed the wine can hear [[Afarni]].  ( _caritas , allister, and arturo_ )

> We hear a haunting whistling emit from the general area, the enemies we see seem to be bucked up by it (courageous anthem)...
> 
> A man steps out from behind some crates, he has a dirty black and grey motley ... in his hands a wicked crescent mood scythe, on which is painted in a crimson red paint ... a grinning or frowning mouth.

His form around the edges is difficult to focus on.  There's a strange aura around his silhouette.  He points at [[Caritas Zespire]] who is sweating from the foul stink.  

> Why so serious? - (he said something else but that was the "vibe")

> Camera focus close shot of Caritas's eyeball which jerks shut, and carit sees a bunch of memories of himself holding the scythe, he sees himself holding this scythe and carve into various prisoners who are people he loves.  Caritas grabs his stomach and is laughing uncontrollably in madness.

### [[Arturo Basri]] discovers some nicknacks from "the summer w/out rain" in a box.  At the bottom of the box is another box (beautifully made) with gold trim.  A beautiful tierra with dazzling white diamonds.  Instantly recognizable from the royal portraits.  This is clearly the royal tierra which belonged to her mother.   [[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] grabs the box but its unclear what she intends to do with it.
