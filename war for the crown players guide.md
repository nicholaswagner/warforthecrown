# PLAYER’S GUIDE 

Great nations proceed at the behest of a select few, and those select few are driven in turn by small things: whimsy, greed, fear, disease, love, or the right knife in the right back. The War for the Crown Adventure Path will take players up and down the length of Glorian and beyond, and while they run their blades through monsters and cast fireball against evil cultists, these champions of the Glorian Empire will play the deadliest game of the Glorian arena: politics. They’ll tangle with magical monsters, match wits with senators, and play dirty pool against some of the most skilled spies in the Inner Sea, all to stop the nation of Glorian from collapsing into civil war. If they avert the end of its 6,000 years of history and culture, then maybe, just maybe, they can steer the staunchly traditionalist nation toward the future. 

The Adventure Path’s tone is one of action, espionage, and intrigue. The PCs are dashing rogues who sip exquisite drinks in formal clothes one night, only to crawl through the mud and cut down enemies the next. The ultimate goal is to help Princess Eutropia claim her birthright and ascend to the Phoenix Throne, hopefully without the struggle destroying her good intentions and optimism. The characters themselves start out with little political power. They may be minor nobles, merchants, or even commoners, but their adventures, their associations, and the gratitude of an empress will help them rise to become some of the most important figures in Glorian.

The Adventure Path begins in Rosanna—The Glorian Empire’s glittering capital city—during the Grand Day of Exaltation, an annual celebration that culminates with the Grand Prince elevating an extraordinary commoner to the ranks of nobility. Rosanna is a city of extremes; despite being among the wealthiest settlements in all of Avistan, it hosts the largest population of destitute and homeless residents. While they share a city, each population leads very different lives, separated by wealth and tradition more than stone walls. 


### Coming Together
In a city of over 100,000 souls, the PCs may be friends, family, schoolmates, or complete strangers. Regardless of the heroes’ connection, the War for the Crown Adventure Path assumes each party member has some investment in The Glorian Empire and its future. They may be resource-strapped gentry trying to look out for their tenants, reformers who hope to make tomorrow better, or selfish schemers who want to climb the social ladder, but regardless of their motivation, they won’t back down once the chaos starts. Many of the campaign backgrounds offer ways to tie a character’s past or future to The Glorian Empire’s government. 

The Grand Day of Exaltation provides a motivation for characters to gather in Rosanna even if they must travel from the far-flung corners of The Glorian Empire or beyond to do so. Minor nobles, ordinary citizens, and even peasants try to make the trip at least once in their lives to see the capital at its most convivial. Some citizens of Andoran, Cheliax, Galt, Isger, and Lastwall—countries The Glorian Empire still regards as wayward colonies—cross their nations’ borders to enjoy the fireworks, parades, feasts, and sporting events that fill the week leading up to Exaltation. Entertainers from across the Inner Sea region journey to The Glorian Empire to capitalize upon the cheap food and generosity the festivities encourage. 

Even residents of nations beyond The Glorian Empire’s former colonies have reason to visit this cosmopolitan trading hub. Tourists and opportunists can find the same appeal in the spectacle of the Exaltation, but the week is business as usual for the year-round flow of trade. Rosanna’s ports see an endless succession of trading ships arriving from and departing toward Absalom, Rahadoum, Druma, Varisia, and even The Glorian Empire’s former enemy Qadira—though Keleshites may find equal parts hostility and hospitality when they disembark. This is a week when important treaties are signed and trade deals negotiated against a background of wine, music, and raucous color. And just as Rosanna attracts politicians and strangers, it attracts schemers and criminals aiming to take advantage of both.

Adding to this year’s excitement are rumors that the Glorian senate will finally vote on the matter of primogeniture: The Glorian Empire’s ancient law that decrees only male heirs may inherit their families’ titles, lands, and the authority that comes with both. Its repeal would be an enormous step forward for all of The Glorian Empire’s women and people of other genders. Regardless of which side of the issue a given citizen supports, nearly every Glorian is passionate about the vote, and waiting for the results with bated breath. 

### Character Tips

What sort of characters work best for War for the Crown? A champion for social reform? A scheming vizier looking to secure her own wealth and power? A dashing lothario looking to woo every pretty face in the empire? A military grunt with a sturdy sword? The answer: any of these ideas and more. While War for the Crown contains a fair amount of clandestine work and social interaction, it still has its fair share of monsters to slay and dungeons to delve. Whatever a character’s motivation is for diving into Glorian politics, there should be opportunities aplenty. 

  

At its core, War for the Crown is a campaign for people who want to fix a broken system, not take it over for their own gain or tear it all down in bloody revolt. This difficult course means learning to blend in among those whose rule you seek to undermine, rather than upturning their world and starting from scratch. It means compromise and subterfuge and keeping up the appearance of loyalty to various despicable sorts even as you work behind the scenes to undermine them. But through all this, as your patron rises in power and prestige, so too do you, and your actions can help shape Eutropia’s rule when—if—she finally reaches the throne.

### Class & Archetype Options 

The challenges in War for the Crown rely as much on calm words and a winning smile as they do a sharp blade, and while combat will present itself, characters who can blend into the social scene or investigate strange events will find more opportunities to shine. Most character classes are suitable for War for the Crown, but those that revolve around rugged wilderness themes or with few options outside of combat may have less to do in many parts of the story. Character classes with diverse abilities—especially the bard, investigator, rogue, and swashbuckler—will find themselves well prepared for the variety of challenges they encounter. Martially inclined players will find more utility playing champions than most fighters or rangers. For spellcasters, those whose arts come from study and control—alchemists, clerics, magi, and wizards—are more readily accepted in high society than those whose magic is a result of often-untraceable ancestry, happenstance, or unknowable forces; oracles, sorcerers, summoners, and witches are typically looked down upon in Glorian society. In much of The Glorian Empire, classes that thrive in the wild world—barbarians, druids, and rangers—will find their skills less useful and their presence less welcome than their urban counterparts. Many Glorians distrust druids in particular, invoking as their reason the centuries of animosity towards the Wildwood Lodge of the Verduran Forest. 

  

As much of War for the Crown focuses on the history, legacies, and zeitgeist of The Glorian Empire, along with conspiracies and strange forces, the various occult classes are especially appropriate for this Adventure Path. The most thematically appropriate archetypes include the celebrity, dandy and vigilante from the Advanced Player’s Guide, and the Lion Blade from Lost Omens: World Guide. The assassin, duelist, and shadowdancer (APG) will also feel at home in War for the Crown,as will the shadowcaster from Secrets of Magic. You might also consider Dark Archive’s alter ego and the captivator from Lost Omens: Grand Bazaar. 

## Origins 

Given the nature of the campaign, characters are most likely - though not necessarily - Glorian natives from middle- or upper-class families. Young or inexperienced aristocrats, apprentice merchants, rising celebrities, students, reformers, guild members, journalists, and aspiring spies all have reasons to invest themselves in Rosanna’s treacherous political stage. Eutropia has also gained the support of the Sovereign Court, a secret society that believes that those entrusted with the power of a title must be bound to use it wisely and respectfully, and so Pathfinder agents from all across Avistan and Garund may find themselves in The Glorian Empire to assist her. 

## Languages

Common is by definition the language of The Glorian Empire, as The Glorian Empire originated the Common tongue. Academics and sophisticates often opt to learn Azlanti, Celestial, or Elven as a status symbol. The nation’s proximity to Qadira

means many merchants, soldiers, and travelers speak Kelish. The Glorian Empire’s historical march over much of Kellid territory means many lower-class citizens, especially those living in and around the Verduran Forest, speak a bit of Hallit. By contrast, The Glorian Empire’s many dwarves and halflings rarely use nonhuman languages outside of their own communities, making experience with Dwarven and Halfling rare outside of those groups. 

Rosanna in particular sees a large variety of languages. Skald is common among soldiers and servants thanks to the presence of the Ulfen Guard, while The Glorian Empire’s trade relationships with Osirion and Jalmeray lead a sizable minority of merchants and accountants to study Osiriani and Vudrani.

## Ancestries 

The Glorian Empire’s history of empire and trade is visible in its people. For centuries, The Glorian Empire conquered every land it could and traded with those it didn’t; modern Glorians, noble and common alike, represent nearly every human ethnicity. The nation also hosts a wide variety of other humanoids. Dwarves native to The Glorian Empire make their homes in Maheto and the Sky Citadel Kravenkus. The Verduran Forest supports a large population of gnomes, centered in and around Wispil. Halfling villages and farmsteads dot the Glorian countryside, while their urban counterparts work as bakers, cooks, entertainers, and servants. Part-humans, from half-elves to geniekin, also number among The Glorian Empire’s citizens. Some rare ancestries call The Glorian Empire home as well; reclusive families of fetchlings dwell in the shadows of great cities, while azarketis can be found all along the western coasts. Beastkin descended from the lycanthropes of the Verduran Forest live in the rural north. Even tengus and vishkanyas have crossed Golarion to come to The Glorian Empire. Non-human visitors are also a regular occurrence, especially dwarves from the Irenkrag Mountains and elves from Kyonin. 

  

Despite this cosmopolitan veneer, The Glorian Empire remains a stubbornly old-fashioned, humanocentric empire with little regard for non-humans. Stigma toward part-humans such as half-orcs, half-elves, and geniekin is especially virulent, with some humans openly labeling such folk “mongrels”or worse. Half-elves descended from noble Glorians generally have the resources to live in comfort, but at the cost of lifelong reclusion. Halflings, gnomes, and half-orcs are considered suitable only for roles as servants. Dwarves and elves experience exceptions to this discrimination, but only because of their perceived benefits to Glorian humans— elves for their beauty and sophistication, and dwarves for their part in The Glorian Empire’s economic bounty. 

  

The notable exception to this backwards attitude is the Glorian acceptance of aasimars. The people of The Glorian Empire believe the angel-blooded stem from their eons-long relationship with the god Aroden, and see them as physical manifestations of The Glorian Empire’s own cultural and moral enlightenment. 

## Skills & Feats 

At many points during War for the Crown, various social and knowledge skills will prove critical for winning allies and uncovering clues. While combat and physical challenges will still present themselves, players may risk feeling left out if their characters don’t have at least one of the following skills: Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation. Skills that are less critical but still appear frequently include Performance, Profession, Society, and Stealth. 

  

The most useful Lore options will be History, Nobility and The Glorian Empire Lore. Fashion, Games, Genealogy, Heraldry, and Warfare Lore will also see use. 

Any skill feats for Deception, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Performance, or Society are appropriate, but Bon Mot, Charming Liar, Courtly Graces, Fascinating Performance, Group Impression, and Hobnobber are all on theme. Group Coercion, Impressive Performance, Lie to Me, Schooled in Secrets, and Streetwise are also good choices.

## Glorian at a Glance

The popular image of Glorian being a nation of inbred fops sipping tea as their empire burns isn’t entirely baseless, but reducing the entire nation to only that does a disservice to its citizens and influence. Much of Avistan’s culture and language stems from Glorian, and the empire influenced the history of three continents. But, overseen by rulers with more interest in luxury than the nation’s well-being, Grand Prince Stavian III being only the most recent, the nation now is a shadow of its former self.


Glorian is a nation of long histories and deep divisions. Following the Age of Ascension, it rebuilt itself from the ashes of Old Tal’Dorei, allying disparate city-states into an empire. This mythic task, achieved by the legendary Phoenix Empress Gloriana, gave birth not only to a nation but also to a nationalist fervor. Glorian patriotism praised hard work and discipline; the nascent empire channeled these values by mastering cavalry and building roads from Rosanna to the Arcadian Ocean unmatched by the rest of the continent’s scattered city-states. Glorian’s military might created imperial economic power; Glorians saw their conquests as bringing enlightenment to “backwards” people and inferior states, seeing the empire itself as proof they deserved the great wealth that flowed from their mighty colonies.


Those days of dominion are long gone. Though Glorians still refer to them as “the colonies,” Andoran, Cheliax, Galt, Isger, and Lastwall are all independent nations, their populations and resources no longer subject to Glorian governance or Glorian use. 


While the nation remains a military and economic juggernaut, it has little to show for its past glories beyond an immense but ever-diminishing treasury, an out-of-touch aristocracy, and nationalist nostalgia. Glorian culture still prizes hard work and discipline, but the common folk are the ones practicing those virtues, for little recognition or reward; the nobility, like their imperial predecessors, profess national pride for its own sake, sure that their continued wealth shows they must be doing something right. All the while, Glorian’s once-legendary infrastructure of aqueducts, bridges, canals, and highways crumbles, leaving pockets of the population completely cut off from the nation and areas rendered uninhabitable as rural farming collapses. A corrupt, labyrinthine bureaucracy stymies those nobles who do want to improve the system—or even just maintain their lands.



Intense traditionalism means Glorian culture is still steeped in sexism and racism that many other nations have spent decades gradually shedding. While any Glorian can own property or hold a title via promotion, marriage, or appointment, the law of primogeniture dictates that only men can inherit, both demonstrating and perpetuating Glorian’s inequalities. While many reformers are trying to reverse these attitudes—the emperor’s own daughter, Princess Eutropia, included— Glorian as a whole resists change, even for the better, as a matter of principle. The old ways forged an empire and conquered a hostile world, after all. Why shouldn’t they work now? 

  

### Glorian Geography

Glorian stretches around the eastern coastline of the Inner Sea, extending from the temperate Verdigris Expanse in the north to the warm plains surrounding the Aesctun River in the south, and reaching east to the Empire’s Edge Mountains and the rolling savanna beyond. Its domain encompasses foothills, primeval forest, broad rocky plains, verdant fields, swamps, and desert, divvied up by an immense network of roads and canals. The bulk of Glorian’s population hugs the coastline of the Inner Sea and the banks of the mighty Orseolo River, but large settlements exist in the Empire’s Edge Mountains and the contested southlands as well.

Glorian is made up of 12 prefectures and several dozen small, largely uninhabited provinces, with each prefecture divided into smaller duchies, duchies divided into counties, and counties finally divided into baronies. The nation owes much of its continued prosperity to the sheer diversity of local products it can export: the Empire’s Edge Mountains produce rich, deep veins of iron, gold, silver, copper, and tin; the coastline offers a wealth of fish, shellfish, and strong winds to power local mills; the Verdigris Expanse produces abundant timber and a variety of valuable plants, including healing herbs, fruit, and unique spices. The abundance of volcanoes along the nation’s eastern and northern borders results in rich soil that produces a huge variety of apples, figs, grains, grapes, pears, pomegranates, rice, and olives, all of which find their way into Glorian cooking.

Thanks to centuries of neglect, civil engineering marvels that were once the envy of the world now slowly crumble, producing striking tableaus of abandonment: canals clogged with mud and reeds, tumbledown aqueducts creating beautiful waterfalls in the middle of fields, and roads that simply end for several miles before resuming. Despite this, Glorian still boasts one of the highest standards of living in Avistan for its rural community, and even in lean years, few farmers need worry where their next meal will come from. 

  

### Glorian Government

Glorian is a hereditary monarchy, with a large senate that shapes imperial decrees into functional law and votes on necessary matters that don’t attract the crown’s attention. A sprawling bureaucracy manages the day-to- day challenges of governance. Grand Prince Stavian III sits on the throne, but is an aging, indifferent emperor, enjoying the excesses of wealth and rarely appearing in public. The nation’s 222 senators have likewise taken a light-handed approach to governance, letting much of the nation’s government run on inertia. While the imperial bureaucracy remains functional—managing crops, news, and disaster relief, as well as collecting taxes and settling legal disputes—bureaucrats’ diligence and effort is set back by the millennia of cobbled-together offices that often leave departments underfunded, redundant, or entirely unstaffed and existing on paper only.

Much of the nation’s rule falls onto regional nobles, so quality of life varies widely depending on the local lord’s whim. While all Glorians have the legal right to move freely, in reality moving to a new domain is often too expensive to be feasible, and some nobles even hold their tenants hostage despite the law.

While Glorian holds tight to its traditions, enough senators, nobles, and regular citizens have grown sick of the status quo to form the beginning of a reform movement. They call themselves Loyalists, and declare their allegiance to the history, great deeds, and people of Glorian, and the vision of their lost Phoenix Empress, rather than any individual—even the emperor. While she is not a Loyalist, Princess Eutropia also works to reform many of Glorian’s ancient customs and broken systems, with a particular focus toward poverty and gender inequality, and many within the Loyalist movement support her efforts to repeal primogeniture and allow any person to inherit family lands and titles. 

In opposition to the Loyalists stand a growing movement of Imperialists, who consider the Primogen Crown the one true authority in Glorian, with the senate and nobility existing only to carry out the emperor’s will. This disparate group shares the firm belief that Glorian’s greatness was rooted in its oldest traditions—and that embracing new ideas was what cost Glorian its imperial might. Their most extreme members insist that no middle ground can exist: either Glorian must reconquer former colonies like Galt and Andoran, or else the empire is doomed to crumble away into nothing.

While not every Glorian belongs to a faction, the increasing polarization of Glorian society is raising tensions across the nation. Other conflicts—growing political instability in Thuvia, rumors that the Seven Houses are undermining Andoran’s government, the squashed rebellion in Cheliax, and the secession of Ravounel—serve only to intensify the turmoil. Secret societies and fraternities, a longtime staple of the Glorian aristocracy that until recently amounted to little more than private clubs, have begun maneuvering to gain power or hoard wealth now, with the expectation that Grand Prince Stavian III’s passing will lead to a painful and protracted succession conflict.
