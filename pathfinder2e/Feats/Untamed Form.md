# Untamed Form
![[pathfinder2e/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You are one with the wild, always changing and adapting to meet any challenge. You gain the [[pathfinder2e/Feats/Untamed Form]] order spell, which lets you transform into a variety of shapes that you can expand with druid feats.
