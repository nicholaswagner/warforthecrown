You point out vulnerabilities present in your hunted prey, granting the benefits listed in [[pathfinder2e/Actions/Hunt Prey]] and your hunter's edge to an ally until the end of their next turn. Depending on whether you call out or use gestures, this action gains either the auditory or visual trait.
