![[pathfinder2e/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You make a ranged Strikewith a thrown weapon you already have in your hand, Stride, and then [[Interact]] to draw another weapon.

If you are [[pathfinder2e/Actions/Rage|Raging]], you can add the additional damage with melee weapons you receive from raging to your damage with the thrown weapon.
