# Precise Finisher
![[pathfinder2e/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

Even when your foe avoids your [[pathfinder2e/Actions/Confident Finisher]], you can still hit a vital spot. On a failure with Confident Finisher, you apply your full precise strike damage instead of half.
