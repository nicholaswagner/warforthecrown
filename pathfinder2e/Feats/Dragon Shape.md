# Dragon Shape
![[pathfinder2e/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You can take on the shape of some of the world's most fearsome creatures. Add the shapes listed in [[Dragon Form]] to your [[pathfinder2e/Feats/Untamed Form]] list. Whenever you're polymorphed into another shape using _untamed form_, you gain resistance 5 to your choice of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison.
