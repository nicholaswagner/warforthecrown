# Keen Magical Detection
![[pathfinder2e/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You sense magical dangers. When using the [[pathfinder2e/Spells/Detect Magic]] exploration activity, you can roll initiative twice and use the better result so long as at least one opponent has a magical effect or magic item and is in range of your [[pathfinder2e/Spells/Detect Magic]].
