# Spellstriker
![[pathfinder2e/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

You gain the magus's [[pathfinder2e/Actions/Spellstrike]] activity. You can recharge it only as an activity that takes 1 minute. This restriction applies even if you gain another ability that recharges Spellstrike.
