# Mimic Protections
![[pathfinder2e/Feats/zz_asset-files/icons-sundries-books-book-red-exclamation.webp|150]]

By adopting resonant reflections, you have learned to copy the abilities of other creatures as well. When you use [[pathfinder2e/Actions/Hunt Prey]] on a foe within 100 feet, you gain resistance 10 to all damage types that target has resistance or immunity to for as long as the foe remains within 100 feet.
