# Session 12 – Exaltation – October 24, 2024 – Location: Imperial Senate of the Glorian Empire

---

-The Senate Speaker calls the Senate to order and begins the roll call for votes, a long and arduous process involving the full names and titles of each Senator. Everyone waits with bated breath as the votes are tallied, Martella counting to herself with each vote. 

  

-When the time comes for Rhenquist to cast his vote, he catches his cousin Cypristian III’s eye as he votes to overturn primogeniture. Rhenquist’s vote creates the majority for overturning primogeniture, and cheers break out on the Senate floor. 

  

-With thirty-six abstentions, the final tally stands at one hundred and seven for, seventy-nine against. The revision stroke passes. The senate recognizes Princess Eutropia Stavian I as the new heir to the Primogen Crown, and the first heir the empire has seen in twenty years. 

  

-Martella approaches the PCs for a victory lap, congratulating and thanking them for a job well done and suggesting that there is a place for them in Eutropia’s court once she is Grand Princess. Regardless, she tells them they’ll be compensated for their work tonight. Finally, she tells them that Kalbio’s parents wrote him a letter, and asks one of the PCs to deliver it, which Allister volunteers to do. 

  

-Cypristian III pulls Rhenquist aside and they exchange harsh words for each other. Cypristian threatens that Rhenquist’s vote has embarrassed the Merosetts and warns that his vote will splinter the family into a full-blown conflict.

  

-Allister delivers the letter to Kalbio and gives him some advice about what to say during the Grand Prince’s presentation. Kalbio admits that he can’t read, and Allister reads the letter from Kalbio’s parents aloud.

-Allister slips a bit of gold into Kalbio’s pocket.

  

-Martella informs them via the badges that she’s secured positions for them in one of the boxes to watch the Exaltation and the Grand Prince’s speech. Everyone takes their places as Grand Prince Stavian takes the stage, flanked by Ulfen Guard and with Kalbio at his side.  

  

-Allister and Arturo notice that Kathann Zalar is the only guard of Glorian heritage - the rest of the guard are made up of Chelish, Andoren, Galtan, even Qadiran men.

| “Quite the assembly we have here today,” the grand prince says. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen the senate building packed so full; especially not for any of my previous speeches. Even my lovely daughter, now a woman, sits among the players of Rosanna’s greatest game. Of course, none of you are here for me. No, today is about something else entirely. Today is about…elevation. It is no secret that today is about exalting others to a new status in life.<br><br>  <br><br>“I’m sure many of you have had the opportunity to meet my friend Kalbio here. He is a man of the people, elevated at the urging of all the ladies, lords, senators, and aides present in this chamber. Are there any who oppose the Exaltation of Master Kalbio? No? It is unanimous then. I think we should all give him a rousing applause, to commemorate this momentous change in his life.” <br><br>“I understand your parents sacrificed everything to help you reach this day, my boy. Saving up for your apprenticeship and the tools you needed to achieve greatness. And today I imagine you are a grateful son, no doubt making them proud.<br><br>“I must admit I envy them. It has been many long years since I have had a grateful child. Nevertheless, your gratitude is, I am sure, what makes all of their sacrifices worthwhile. You see, I too understand what it is to sacrifice; I have given so much for the people of this nation: a brother, a son, a lifetime of service. Even my own daughter’s loyalty.” <br><br>The crowd grows deathly silent. He pauses, licking his lips and pulling the awkward Kalbio closer to his side. “But unlike you, Lord Kalbio, these Glorians—my children, truly—are not grateful. They scheme and plot. They dream of hanging their dutiful father and placing a woman—a woman, sir!—on the Lion Throne! And they have seen fit this very day to induct you unanimously into their conspiratorial ranks.” The Grand Prince reaches into his cloak, pulls out a jeweled dagger and plunges it into Kalbio’s breast. “And that,” he stabs, “is why here, now, you, Lord Kalbio,” he stabs, “will be the first among them to die!” |

  

![[angry_man_yelling_at_ground.png]]

  

-Scores of “guards” throw aside their cloaks to reveal armor and weapons and begin cutting down Senators, nobles, children, guests, and servants in a bloody and wholesale slaughter as the Grand Prince laughs and gloats maniacally. 

  

-Chaos erupts through the Senate floor. Sellswords close the doors and block the exits, and the Ulfen Guard close ranks around the Grand Prince, creating an impenetrable field of swinging blades around him. Eutropia pleads with her father to call off this massacre, but he only directs the assassins to turn their attention to his daughter. ![[man_riding_lion.png]]

  

-Earl Calhadian Vernisant bursts into the chamber on a lion mount, wearing his ancestor’s armor, and turns his weapons against the innocents in the room, revealing his part in the massacre. 

  

-Allister sets his sights on his grandmother, the Dowager Duchess, who is struggling with her wheelchair in the crowd. He leaps down from the box and attempts to wade through the crowd to reach her, taking a moment to inspire courage in his fellow PCs.

  

-Caritas follows Allister out of the box, hoping to lend his skills to aid the victims, though he’s distracted by a strange voice in his head pleading to be unbound. 

  
![[senate_mass_begins.png]]

-Tirri struggles with her gown but eventually gets out of the box and tries to make her way toward Kalbio to see if she can save him before he is gone. 

  

-Rhenquist feels his heart rate speed up exponentially as he finds himself subject to the haste spell. He searches the crowd for his mother and finds her and Cypristian III, who is trying to fight off assassins as he escorts his aunt out of the building. Rhenquist tries to reach them, bobbing and weaving and hiding where he can behind other figures. 

  

-Grand Duchess Heskillar insists that she won’t leave her friend Zarissa in the Senate and goes off to try to find her. 

  

-Marquess Deschamps uses necromancy to reanimate some of the fallen corpses and uses them to fight against the sellswords.

  

-Allister sees the Duchess’s wheelchair knocked over, leaving his grandmother helpless on the floor. An assassin approaches to deliver a killing blow to the terrified duchess, but the man is turned to dust and ash by High Arcanist Duke Panivar Lotheed. Allister uses his magic to cast a warding spell over his grandmother, shielding her from the attentions of the sellswords. ![[blue-hair-supportive.png]]

  

-Arturo finds Head Curator Copernia Vau unconscious and injured from being trampled. He applies battlefield medicine to her and asks if there’s another exit in the room. She says the portrait of the Empress at the front of the room has a secret passage built in, and he picks her up and begins making his way across the floor. 

  

-Caritas tries to engage one of the sellswords in combat but can’t land a strike through their armor. The voice continues begging for Caritas to draw steel, but with his sword peace-tied, Caritas doesn’t have an opportunity to do so. 

  

-Tirri continues fighting to get to Kalbio, escorted now by her uncle Remilliard. Once within distance, she casts a stabilizing spell, ending Kalbio’s crawl to death, though he remains unconscious and in critical condition. Remilliard throws his body in front of an assassin’s sword, taking a blow to the shoulder that was meant for Countess Pace’s neck. 

  
![[lady_glorianna_morilla_violin.png]]

-Lady Morilla picks up a fallen musician’s violin and begins channeling her own bardic magic through it, attempting to lead Princess Eutropia through the path cleared by Marquess Deschamp. Eutropia refuses to follow, determined to rally people to fight in defense of the Glorians in the senate. 

  

-Rhenquist reaches his mother, who expresses her worry in a typically Nevanna way - scolding Rhenquist for coming to her side instead of making it out of the Senate. She maintains the haste spell she cast upon him. 

  

-High Strategos Maxillar Pythareus takes up arms against the aggressors, fighting in defense of the people as the Grand Prince laughs, seethes, and taunts the victims in equal measure before catching a crossbow to the chest. 

  

-One of the sellswords turns his attention toward Allister and raises his sword to strike Allister down. The moment the blade makes contact with Allister’s skin, all of the PCs are blinded by a flash of cold white light, and the din of terrified screaming falls silent and they find themselves far from the violence on the Senate floor and completely in the dark. 

  

![[throneroom_map.jpg]]

-Allister uses his magic to create light, and the PCs find themselves and each other in a musty room with faded, peeling wallpaper, six dust-caked but pristinely made beds, and a set of wooden lockers. A portrait of a man in armor and an ostentatiously feathered helmet looms over them in the dim lighting. With no idea where they are or how they got there, the PCs begin to explore their new surroundings. ![[feather_hat.png]]

  

-Rhenquist recognizes the armor as typical ceremonial armor associated with the Fourth Army of Exploration, and Caritas recognizes the face of long-dead Senator Albio Voritas, though he existed long after the Fourth Army of Exploration. Rhenquist also finds a few random items in one of the lockers - a grooming kit, a few sets of moth-eaten clothing, and a simple hand mirror. With no other sign of anything significant, the party decides to leave the room and explore the area further. 

  

-In the next room, the PCs discover a storage chamber. Huge piles of crates cover most of a wall, and a few sets of wooden shelves holding dust-covered crockery and jars. Arturo notices at the top corner of the wall a piece of a colorful mosaic, but the rest of the image is obscured by the piles of crates. Arturo finds a repair kit, and the PCs move on. 

  

-The PCs piece together what must have happened - a failsafe enchantment on their badges activated when one of them was in danger, whisking them all to a safe place. Rhenquist recalls learning that Senator Voritas was one involved in an altercation on the Senate floor, and assume that the enchantment on his master’s badge must have already been spent, leaving Martella unprotected. 

  

-In the next room, heavy wooden bookshelves line the walls of an opulent bedchamber. A posh chair sits in the northwestern corner alongside a small circular table. A massive bed and an adjoining table rest along the eastern side of the room. An open bathroom fits into the southwest, with a bathtub matching the room’s opulence, but adding an ignoble odor. On the wall, a tapestry depicting the Voritas family crest - a unicorn in combat with a linnorm - hangs grandly. 

  

-Rhenquist recognizes what the tapestry represents, and upon examining it finds a well-concealed hole in the tapestry where the unicorn’s eye should be. Behind the hole is a small indentation with the impression of the unicorn and linnorm carved into the wall. ![[tapestry-snake-and-horse.png]]

  

-Martella contacts the PCs through her Master Senator’s Badge. The PCs respond, telling her what they know about where they are and peppering her with questions about their loved ones and the state of the Senate, but they receive no further response.

|“Where did you go? I just saw you and several others in the Senate vanish into thin air. Lady Morilla, the Princess, and I are together. Baron Okerra and Count Zespire have escorted us out of the melee and into a hiding spot. Are you all safe? Oh, I hope you’re all safe.”|

  

-Upon further investigation, Rhenquist identifies a number of the moldering books on the bookshelves as historical tomes on the Fourth Army of Exploration. Senator Voritas was clearly a fan of the era. Two books remain in good condition. One, A Brief Accounting of the Topography of the Andoren Province, is nothing more than it seems, but a second, Maramaxus’ March on the Mountain, is hollowed out. Inside, Rhenquist finds a strange clear glass cylinder about the size and shape of his index finger. 

  

-In the bathroom, Allister finds a bronzed scroll case hanging on the railing of the bathtub. Inside, a scrap of parchment reads “Fourth bed from the North. Comforter. Backup key.” Caritas returns to the Servants’ Quarters and slices the comforter open, finding a small silver key inside. Allister also finds a large, ornate golden key on the table. 

  

-Speaking of Caritas, he finds himself distracted by a voice in his head which appears by all accounts to be coming from his sword Provenance. No one else can hear it. Provenance seems thrilled to be out of his scabbard, though he objects to being used to rip open a comforter. 

  

-The PCs walk into the final room, which seems to be furnished to be a parlor or lounge. A wooden counter juts from the northwest corner of the chamber. Open cabinets of dusty liquor bottles stand behind the bar, while one cabinet remains tightly sealed with a visible silver lock. Three tables with adjacent chairs fill much of the room. Portraits of posing nobles and historical scenes from the Fourth Army of Exploration adorn the walls, all faded with age.

  

-Most of the bottles of liquor have soured or evaporated, but Rhenquist does find two bottles of whiskey worth 20sp each.
