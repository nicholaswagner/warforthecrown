# Session 14 – Hollow Suits – November 6, 2024 – Location: The Museum of Conquests

---

  

-The PCs leap into action to defend themselves and the other nobles from three animated suits of armor after Allister takes a brutal blow to the head from a rusted gauntlet, knocking him unconscious. Tirri uses her magic to restore him to consciousness as the others turn to their weapons. 

  

-The armor proves effective at its intended use: deflecting the blows of weapons. Rhenquist realizes that the armor can be broken, decreasing its resilience against their weapon attacks, and demonstrates by breaking the first suit of armor. 

  

-A difficult battle ensues as the PCs and the suits of armor exchange rocking blows, but at last Rhenquist dispenses with the final suit of armor and the party takes time to tend to their wounds. 

  

-Tirri detects another magical item on display - the portable alchemical lab of famed natural philosopher Dumas Fatomax, along with a set of stoppered potions. The party pockets the lab and the potions, and prepares to continue exploring their way out of the buried Senate. 

  

-Arturo ventures into the next room, where the party is greeted by the silhouettes of dozens of shadowy figures dressed in finery, apparently frozen in time.
