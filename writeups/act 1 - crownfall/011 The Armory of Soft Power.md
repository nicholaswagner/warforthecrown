![[Archibald-LaDrock.png]]

-While the other PCs were handling the problem of Dame Malphene Trant, Allister was preoccupied in private conversation with Andoren Ambassador Archibald LaDrock, newly appointed with the incoming Marusek Administration. LaDrock presses Allister on his thoughts about the upcoming vote, expresses his (and Andoran’s) condemnation of the monarchy, and makes overtures toward Allister returning to his home land. They discuss Allister’s goal of establishing a new shipping lane with Andoran, and the Ambassador invites Allister to the embassy for further discussion on the matter.

|“I hope, Mr. Hound, that you are not so talented at bluffing and deception that you have deceived yourself into believing that any true freedom can come to Glorian under the rule of her dynastic overlords.”|

Round 7![[breezy_creek_boi.png]]

  

-Allister tries to spread gossip about Countess Pace, but finds himself stonewalled by Lady Gloriana Morilla, who seems both distracted and disinterested in engaging in petty gossip. Allister abandons Lady Morilla and seeks out Kalbio of Breezy Creek, the weaver who is to be elevated at the Exaltation later tonight. Kalbio is a friendly country bumpkin, deeply out of place in high society. He immediately takes to Allister, who helps Kalbio correctly arrange his complicated clothing. Kalbio attaches himself to Allister for the rest of the evening.

  
  

-Caritas takes the letter for Duke Centimus and the file folder and delivers them to the Imperial Archives. The Duke accepts the letter and offers no response, so Caritas goes to socialize with his uncle, Count Orlundo Zespire. Pressed to reveal his vote, Count Zespire brings Caritas to a mural of the Empress and delivers a monologue about why the Count will be voting in the Princess’s favor tonight.

|“The efficiency of the empress is the stuff of lore. They say that when she decided she wanted something, the time it took to secure it could be measured in heartbeats. Not so for Princess Eutropia. Her progress over the years can be measured in inches. Slowly, slowly she has crawled around the empire, doling out favors, brokering alliances, turning enemies into friends, carefully and methodically selecting her foes, building her armory of soft power. She hopes to learn tonight that all of her efforts might not be in vain. I admire her perseverance, and I shall not be an obstacle to her.” -Orlundo Zespire, the Iron Gar|

  
![[viscountess_octavia_nicodemus.png]]

-Arturo approaches the [[Viscountess Octavia Nicodemus]] , perhaps the oldest living woman in the Glorian Empire. As he does, he notices a hairless cat covered in inscrutable runes weaving around her ankles, and tries to connect by showing off his own tattoos. The Viscountess asks for permission, then runs her tongue along the tattoo, noting that Arturo tastes like a curious man. If he is indeed curious, he might be interested in visiting the Endless Repository, a mysterious archive of occult lore which she serves as caretaker. She offers Arturo a candle which she says will grant him access to the Repository, along with a set of instructions: it must be lit in a perfectly dark room, his access to the repository will last until the candle burns out, and everyone who comes with him must stand within the candle’s dying light as it extinguishes, or else be lost to the Endless Repository forever. This interaction is uncomfortably intimate and involves a lot of saliva, but is nevertheless successful. As he is leaving, Arturo notices a perfect circles scratched into a wooden table leg, but decides to investigate that later - there is still work to be done tonight. ![[Nicodemus_cat.png]]

  
  

-Rhenquist seeks out his mother for advice about whom to consort with at the Senate, and finds her standing on a balcony looking out over the not-yet-dispersed crowd of people who gathered to catch a glimpse of the Grand Prince. Nevanna gently rebukes her son for showing vulnerability in public as he complains about his difficult upbringing, but eventually shares what information she knows about the Gala’s attendees.

  

-Tirri continues trying to influence the Imperial Archives by chatting about former Exaltees. She is slowly winning over the notoriously unfriendly archive-dwellers.

Round 8

  

-A light dinner is served, improving people’s spirits and the prospects for socialization.

  

-Allister and Kalbio go to greet the returned Princess Eutropia, who seems very fond of Kalbio. Kalbio goes off to get wine (liquid grapes) for Allister and Eutropia, who take the opportunity to catch up. Eutropia is delighted to be reunited with her old friend, and Allister earns a Hero Point for everyone in the party and an invitation to reconnect after the gala.

  

-Caritas, determined to embarrass Count Lotheed, conspired with Lady Gloriana Morilla, charming her in the process and earning an unknown favor from her later. He excuses himself from that conversation and tries to surreptitiously plant bird seed in Bartleby’s pockets, but he’s caught in the act. Bartleby and Caritas exchange barbs, but when Caritas shows him the bird seed, Bartleby blanches and unconsciously touches a scar near his hairline from where his father harmed him that summer. Caritas leaves Bartleby, having secured a somewhat pyrrhic victory. 


> “Ah, Zespire, so good to see you out in society tonight, and with no visible sores!”
 -Bartleby Lotheed, Cutting Count


![[marquess_charlotte_deschamps.png]]

-Arturo meets [[Marquess Charlottte Deschamps]], a somber woman who is a known member of the Pathfinder Society. Arturo discusses the relics in the Arcade of Triumphs, noting that at least some of them are mere replicas. Marquess Deschamps asks if he’s interested in artifacts and treasures. If he is, she invites him to visit a Pathfinder lodge and offers to let him use her name for access. 

  

-Rhenquist approaches [[Duke Georgi Talbot]], a wealthy and influential merchant. They have small talk about the squid dish before Duke Talbot launches into business talks, insisting that Rhenquist’s grandfather has spurned Talbot’s offers for partnership to his own disadvantage, and that with his help the Merosetts could expand them gemstone business beyond the empire’s borders. He mentions that if the Merosetts really want their business to boom, he should be voting to uphold Primogeniture, because the wars that the High Strategos envisions will create massive demand for gemstones. 
![[duke_georgi_talbot_2.png]]

  

-Tirri continues working the Imperial Archives, but her efforts are interrupted when a tour guide brings a bunch of young nobles into the archives to share ghost stories about the Senate building.

  

|   |
|---|
|“This is the current senate structure, built atop the ruins of several other iterations. There has been a senate building on this spot since it was founded by the empress over 3000 years ago, shortly after the rising of the Starstone. Do you want to hear something very interesting? We’re standing on one of the empire’s oldest graveyards. It is said the senate halls are haunted by many restless spirits which are said to materialize in the earliest hours of the morning, hence why we will be leaving before 1 am, when the ghosts begin their own congress. While there are many stories of senators dying in duels, accidents, even poisonings - there was even a grand prince who died on the floor of the senate - most of these ghosts are the results of the intentional interment of workers, a grim reward from the nobles of that time. To keep the secrets of the senate building secrets, they would bury them alive in the walls. Next up - the wall of busts!”|

Round 9

  

-Allister meets Landgrave Ogvai Jarlbjorn, an Ulfen man who achieved his title and Senate seat after successfully sounding the alarm and defending his village against an incursion of frost giants. The man talks with Allister about how silly the Glorian people and their obsession with history and hair are, referring to the recently revoked law disallowing commoners to grow beards and his discovery that the lowborn often sell their hair for the upper class’s wigs. It’s a strange conversation for the Senate, but Allister wins the Landgrave’s respect and an invitation to visit him in his village near Yanmass.

  

[[Caritas Zespire]] returns to the Imperial Archives and gets the party over the threshold for influencing the room. His uncle gives him a folio he stumbled upon that once belonged to an ancestor of theirs named Musetta Zespire. Flipping through the folio, Caritas learns that Musetta was an event planner for the Imperial Senate, and he discovers a small collection of spell scrolls in the back pocket of the folio. The scrolls are for the spells Blur, Confetti Cloud, Marvelous Mount, Charitable Urge, Haste, and Roaring Applause

  
![[Marquess_tanasha_starborne.png]]

[[Arturo Basri]] introduces himself to [[Marquess Tanasha Starborne]], a gnomish woman representing the town of Wispil. She loudly proclaims that she’ll be voting to overturn primogeniture, partially because she thinks the law is unjust but also because she thinks it will cause several entertaining fights on the senate floor. The Marquess finds Arturo entertaining, and extends an invitation to him to visit Wispil at his leisure, promising a gift to him when he does.

  

[[Rhenquist-Merosett]] goes to speak with the High Arcanist Duke Panavar Lotheed. The Duke makes overtures of friendship toward Rhenquist and tells him that his offer to teach him the arcane arts stands. There is guarded discussion about politics and the pulling of strings, and when the topic turns to the vote tonight, Duke Lotheed insists that he has no vote, though he refers obliquely to the question of which is more valuable - a vote in and of itself, or well-wielded influence. Eventually, Duke Lotheed offers an answer of sorts. 
  

|   |
|---|
|“It is my firmly and deeply held conviction that the Glorian Empire requires strong, decisive leadership,” Duke Lotheed answered cryptically. “And that a Stavian should always sit the Lion Throne.”|

  

-Tirri queens out with Earl Gahez Varima, who compliments her dress effusively and admires the flora of the courtyard. He tells her that he is from Vudra, a land of lotuses and perfume, and maintains an extensive network of contacts with Keleshites and, especially, Qadirans. He invites her to visit his estate in Zimar, should she ever find herself in Sophra prefecture.

#### Round 10
  

-At last, [[General High Stratagos Maxillar Pythareus]] returns to the Arcade of Triumphs after his conversation with the Grand Prince. Rhenquist, Allister, and Caritas all try to eavesdrop on his conversation with Milon Jeroth, and they all hear him express his confusion and uncertainty over the Grand Prince’s behavior since he arrived at the gala. Pythareus admits that he doesn’t know what’s going on with the Grand Prince tonight, but he feels uneasy about something. Jeroth assures him that they have arranged for everything to work out in their favor, regardless of the outcome of the vote. 

  

[[Arturo Basri]], confident from his successes throughout the evening, attempts to win influence with Grand Duke Avernathus, but he is unable to win the Grand Duke’s attention away from the (very) young man with whom Avernathus is engaged. 
  

[[Tirri-Kastner]] takes an opportunity to show off her dancing skills in the courtyard to a tune being played by [[Lady Glorianna Morilla]], but her dance is interrupted by a blare of trumpets and [[Martella-Lotheed]]’s telepathic communication informing her - and the rest of the PCs - that the Speaker has called the Senate to Order, and the vote is about to begin.
