-As Rhenquist and Tirri brace themselves to resist Dame Trant’s attacks, their companions try to support them as best they can from afar as they hurry to join their friends in the Beldam II Conference Room. 

  

-Arturo tries to get the attention of Lady Gloriana Morilla in the Courtyard, because Martella had mentioned that she was a trustworthy ally, but he is unable to divert her attention from the conversation she is engaged in. He abandons the attempt and begins to make the journey across the Senate Building.

|“It’s just like I told Daddy. There are some problems you just can’t solve with words.” -Dame Malphene Trant|

  

-Tirri uses her magic to send a message to Kathann Zalar alerting her of the altercation - luckily, the guard is within range of the spell, though she cannot send a response. 

  

-Dame Trant distracts Rhenquist by placing her hand on her shortsword’s pommel before sucker punching him in the face. Her companions rush into the fray, and begin to lay into Rhenquist. Rhnquist uses his Courtly Graces ability to pretend he is Duke Lotheed’s cousin, successfully frightening Dame Trant and taking the opportunity to escape the fray and rush out of the conference room. 

  

-Caritas, in the Imperial Archives, asks Duke Centimus to alert a guard that there’s trouble in the gallery, and then dashes off toward the Beldam II Conference Room. He sees an unfamiliar man in the doorway (Rhenquist, under the effects of the infiltrator’s elixir) and Tirri struggling against Trant’s thugs, though no sound is coming from the room. 

  

-Tirri tries to escape to safety, but Malphene and her thugs get the better of her, and she falls unconscious under the force of their assault. 

  

-Rhenquist critically succeeds on a recall knowledge on Dame Trant, realizing that she is insecure about her appearance and doesn’t fit into the mold expected of young women in society. He also recognizes Lord Remilliard Kastner, Tirri’s uncle and the head of the Kastner family. Rhenquist runs to Lord Kastner and lets him know that Tirri is in trouble, and Remilliard hurries to the conference room. ![[dant_trant_throwing_hands.png]]

  

-Caritas rushes in with a sudden charge, landing two crushing blows on one of Dame Trant’s thugs and knocking him unconscious immediately. Dame Trant retaliates with a critical punch on Caritas, sending him reeling backward into the armored body of Lord Remilliard Kastner, who pushes him aside and rushes to tend to Tirri. 

  

-Zarissa finally makes her way to the gallery, but as she climbs the stairs she passes Martella Lotheed, who intercepts Kathann Zalar, telling her that the situation in the conference room is not what Kathann fears and that everything is under control. Zarissa rushes into the conference room to try to soothe Tirri, but is clotheslined by Dame Trant and nearly knocked unconscious. She decides to use her magic to heal herself first. ![[not-really-sure.png]]

  

-Arturo asks Martella why she turned Kathann Zalar away, and Martella explains that she is hoping to avoid a panic in the Senate building, or any excuse to dismiss the Senators before the vote. She reiterates that she trusts them to handle the situation quietly. Arturo shifts gears, devoting his efforts to try to pull attention away from the altercation. He goads Wyssilka the Fantabulous to try to get her to cause a distraction, but the clown demands twice the gold he was offering. Failing to negotiate, Wyssilka announces to the children that the man with the blue hair has candy, and Arturo is mobbed. 

  

-With Lord Kastner in the room, Dame Trant and her cronies decide to abandon their attempts to intimidate Senator Dou and flee the room instead. On the way out, Caritas trips Malphene, embarrassing her as she leaves. 

  

-A grateful Senator Dou thanks the PCs for rescuing him and tells them to contact him the next day for payment for his gratitude. He excuses himself from the room. Lord Kastner warns Tirri to be careful, as tensions are high in the Senate building tonight, and he too, excuses himself. The party reconvenes and licks their wounds - though they succeeded in stopping Dame Trant from bullying Senator Dou, almost everyone is worse for wear. 

  

-With that done, the PCs resume their projects.

Round 6

  

-Zarissa unites with Grand Duchess Heskillar in the gallery and manages to influence the gallery beyond the first threshold, earning an additional action for the party each social round.  

  

-Caritas tries to exert influence over the Imperial Archives with a diplomacy check, but makes a nuisance of himself instead. He is scolded by the ancient Viscountess Octavia Nicodemus, who reminds him that he is in a library while blindly staring into his soul.

  

-On his way to spy on High Strategos Maxillar Pythareus, Rhenquist runs into his cousin Cypristian III, who presses Rhenquist to support the family’s interest by voting to uphold primogeniture.  He first insinuates that Rhenquist’s mother is manipulating him into doing her dirty work, then offers to legitimize Lens as a true Merosett. Rhenquist demurs, then stakes out a hiding spot to spy on Pythareus. ![[lady_glorianna_morilla.png]]

  

-Tirri arrives at the Courtyard to deliver her missive to Lady Gloriana Morilla. Lady Morilla is engaged in a conversation with a handful of other nobles who are laughing at a story about a Duke’s abusive behavior toward one of his servants, a story Lady Morilla clearly disdains. She relishes the opportunity for escape that Tirri provides, and takes a turn around the Courtyard with her. After reading Martella’s message, she quickly scrawls two responses and asks Tirri to deliver them - one to Martella, and one to Duke Centimus. 

  

-In the wine cellar, Arturo struggles to find the best way to sabotage Bartleby’s wine. Finally, he chooses the spot on the cork and plunges in the syringe, putrefying the wine, which immediately loses the magical frost on the outside of the bottle, and completing Martella’s Mission of Pettiness.

Round 7

  

-Zarissa continues trying to influence the Gallery, as Caritas and Arturo attempt to influence the Imperial Archives, with little success. 

  

-Rhenquist observes a tense conversation between High Strategos Pythaereus and Duke Panivar Lotheed. Pythaereus boasts about his fortunes and his title as the future Grand Prince, while Lotheed goads him with skepticism, disapproval, and simmering hostility. They part on awkward terms. 

  

-Tirri runs Lady Morilla’s letter to Martella and updates her on what they’ve learned so far. Martella laments Countess Pace’s two-faced nature, informs Tirri that the rumors about Earl Vernisant are spreading, and asks Tirri to return a file folder to the Archives for her when she drops the letter off to Duke Centimus. 

  

-A sudden furor rips through the Senate building as word of Grand Prince Stavian III’s arrival spreads. Servants unroll a long red carpet through the arcade of triumphs and down the 100 steps to the front of the Senate as hundreds of Ulfen Guard take their positions on each side of the carpet. Out of a golden carriage steps the Grand Prince, a withered shell of a man the PCs remember from the Summer Without Rain. The years have taken a heavy toll on the grand prince, who seems stooped over almost from the weight of the very crown on his head. He slowly ascends the stairs, taking many breaks to wave feebly at the crowd gathered at the Arcade of Triumphs and beyond the gates to the Senate. ![[elderly_prince_stavian.png]]

  
  
  

-The PCs murmur to each other about the Grand Prince’s diminished state. Rhenquist in particular wonders how any Glorian can take pride in this kind of leadership. 

  

-At the top of the stairs, Princess Eutropia and High Strategos Pythareus wait to receive the Grand Prince. Stavian III looks at his daughter with disdain and disgust, ignoring her greeting altogether, and allows the High Strategos to escort him instead. The Grand Prince and the High Strategos hurry through the building, whisking away into the Grand Prince’s private offices.

  

-Distressed by the sight of a father, Eutropia excuses herself to take meetings of her own. Martella explains that the Princess hasn’t seen the Grand Prince in over a decade. When the PCs tell Martella what they’ve learned of the High Strategos’s plan, she assures them that it’s not the winning blow the High Strategos might think it is - naming Pytharius as heir will still require senate approval, and if they can secure a comfortable enough margin on the vote to overturn primogeniture, it may prove to be enough of a firewall to undermine the Grand Prince’s scheme. She urges them to continue on with their work tonight, and excuses herself to aid the Princess.
