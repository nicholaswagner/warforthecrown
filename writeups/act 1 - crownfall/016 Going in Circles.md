# Session 16 – Going in Circles – November 18, 2024 – Location: The Underground Senate

---

  

-As the party recovers from the wounds they sustained against the animated griffon, Lord Wilfen Bothess makes a scene by striking Imostos Gulbend and accusing him of trying to get them all killed. Caritas yanks Lord Bothess away from Imostos and threatens him with violence for harming the halfling. Lord Bothess is confused by this reaction from a fellow noble, and Caritas’s sword Provenance is outraged that Caritas used the sword to threaten Bothess.

|“How dare you turn me against an unarmed enemy? I am no executioner’s blade!”|

  

-Zarissa tries to soothe Imostos after Lord Bothess’s abuse, and he offers her the only thing he can find in thanks - a piece of saltwater taffy.

-As the party moves on from the animatronic storage room, they enter into a long hallway with a wooden door on either end and a large, ornate metal double door in the center, across from the storage rooms. The metal door is covered in overlapping, interlocking circles and mathematical notes. 

  

-Arturo, Allister, and Rhenquist study the double doors, and as they focus, the circles on the doors begin to rotate and spin. Rhenquist avoids the effect of the circles, but Arturo and Allister fall prey to them. They experience an illusion of endlessly falling, spinning, shattering through an endless hallway for seconds that feel like hours or days, leaving them both deeply sickened and confused. They lash out at their companions, reckless in their desperation, their eyes fixed on the circles on the door. 

  

-Rhenquist realizes that the circles are drawn in chalk, and decides to smash the bottle of fine whiskey from Senator Voritas’s safe room against the door, shattering the glass and splashing whiskey on the metal doors and melting the chalk circles away. 

With the visual effect destroyed, Arturo and Allister come back to their senses.

  

-The party decides to leave the metal doors for now and investigate what’s behind the doors on either end of the hallway. As they approach the first of these doors, they detect a damp smell reminiscent of moss on riverstones. Inside they find a vast stone chamber covered in overgrown blackberry bushes, kudzu, and moss, with a bit of outdoor furniture and a small gazebo across the room. They enter cautiously, and in doing so detect a bit of motion, which Allister identifies as a garden ooze. The party carefully avoids the ooze’s detection and finds a sealed minor potion of healing. With that, they decide to leave the Seed Vault and return to the hallway. 

  

-The party passes the metal doors as they cross to the other side of the hallway and into a small Archive overflowing with a vast collection of senate minutes, census reports, records, accounting, self-aggrandizing journals, genealogies, autobiographies of self-aggrandizing nobles, and sample textbooks for Senate approval. Arturo notices that layers of dust covered most areas of the room, but some spots are suspiciously clean and free of dust. He examines one of these desks and finds piles of math and geometry books, as well as a small worn leather journal sporting a family crest on the cover depicting a wreath encircling two crowns. Arturo slips the journal into his pocket. 

  

-Zarissa examines the room for anything resembling a spell scroll, and finds a beautiful scroll case. When she opens it, though, she finds not a spell scroll, but an animated and aggressive scroll that attacks her immediately, wrapping around her face and trying to suffocate her. 

  

-Arturo takes a moment to try to devise a stratagem, and, realizing that this is yet another construct, dashes forward and pulls the scroll off of Zarissa’s face. 

  

-The party tries to attack the scroll, but no one is able to land a hit on it as it flutters and floats through the air. The scroll wraps itself around Arturo’s face.

  

-Zarissa hurls her needle darts at the scroll, finally making contact as they begin to splinter through the wooden supports, then she directs Periwinkle the baby badger to attack the scroll. Periwinkle leaps up and grabs the edge of the parchment with his claws, ripping the scroll in half. The blank parchment flutters harmlessly to the ground.

  

-Zarissa pockets the fancy scroll case. 

  

-The party takes a moment to recuperate. 

  

-Caritas has a conversation with Provenance in which he asks Provenance how the sword wants to be wielded. The sword responds that a worthy wielder of a Rysherin sword will always use it correctly - the question is, is Caritas a worthy wielder, or, at least, can he become one? 

  

-Tirri tries to find records of her family, but to no avail - another reminder, among the records of the high nobles of the Glorian Empire, of the Kastners’ relative irrelevance and low station. 

  

-Rhenquist detects a soft buzzing sound coming from behind the next door, and when they open it, they are greeted by a little spherical creature with buzzing dragonfly wings.

-The creature introduces itself as Factor 12, from the plane of Axis, here on a contract to act as a curator of sorts in the Senate’s Library of Rare Artifacts. 

  

|   |

|“Hello! I am Factor 12! I would be happy to facilitate a withdrawal for you, provided, of course, that you have obtained the appropriate forms and permits!”|

  

-Factor 12 explains that this room houses a number of valuable items in the possession of the Senate, but because of a recent violation of the rules, he can only allow the group to withdraw a single item. The violation was committed by King Dagio, who Dagio withdrew the Ring of Henricus Hound, then used it to override Factor 12’s directive and steal a wand (which he incorrectly called a scepter), an amulet, and an old journal belonging to Eros Glendower. 

  

-Factor 12 catalogues a number of impressive items in the Senate Archive and tells them that he can reinstate the original rules - that one item per person, rather than per group, be withdrawn - if they can return the items King Dagio stole. He tells them King Dagio holds court on the other side of the metal door with the circles drawn on it.  As some people deliberate, others question Factor 12 about the underground Senate building and King Dagio. 

  

-Factor 12 says that, of the group in front of him, King Dagio looks most similar to Periwinkle the badger or Primrose the opossum. He also reveals that he rarely leaves this chamber - the last time he did so, it was in pursuit of King Dagio. 

  

-One of the items Factor 12 has is a silver key, which he believes the party will need to find Dagio. Zarissa talks him into handing over the key without counting it as their single withdrawn item. 

  

-Factor 12 offers to let the party rest in the adjoined Reading Room and promises to inform them if anyone else enters the archive. 

  

-In the reading room, the party kicks off their shoes, unlaces their corsets, and begins to settle in for a few hours of sleep. Zarissa successfully repairs the cold iron buckler Caritas found. Allister plumbs the archives outside for information about Henricus Hound and discovers that he was a Glorian diplomat who was dispatched to the province of Andoran shortly after the Fourth Movement. 

  

-Arturo reads the journal he stole, and finds a collection of mysterious notes:

  
  

|   |
|---|
|1 Pharasmus 4528<br><br>  <br><br>Today I began the grand experiment.  I had purchased Dagio when he was already old and half blind and though magical processes common to wizardry prolonged his life by binding it to mine, still his vitality ebbed and waned even now, and I feared if I had to wait much longer he would not survive the process ahead of him. Nature despises the old and infirm. I must begin immediately.|

  
  

|   |
|---|
|Success! I came down to my lab and found Dagio was not dead but in fact lay sleeping comfortably. He looked worn and gray but perhaps a little less feeble than the night before and opened his eyes when I spoke his name. When he fully awoke he ate for the first time this week. I returned to check on him later after a long and droll Senate meeting over the expulsion of the Cult of the Dawnflower and found Dagio moving about out of the sick bed I’d made for him. I must not get ahead of myself - a small improvement does not mean the ritual was a success.|

  

Several pages of medical documents and measurements, weight, food intake, etc. 

  
  

|   |

|Sarenith<br><br>  <br><br>Already three months since the experiment began. The process is not instantaneous but is instead continuous, for as in all things time is needed to heal. Dagio moves with energy and vigor I have never seen in the years I’ve known him. He says he feels young again and I have observed no signs of mental or physical side effects. His full sight has even returned. It was a success! I have reversed aging and perhaps even cured it. With this discovery every noble in Glorian can enjoy eternal life and youth without need for the rare and ridiculously expensive Sun orchid elixir. I must inform the circle posthaste.”|

  
  

|   |

|Lamashan<br><br>  <br><br>“I am beginning to fear I have been trapped by the circle. Though the Circle has kept their end of the bargain, providing me with access to long-forgotten texts and “handling” the tedium that my inherited Senate seat demands, it is becoming increasingly clear to me that the Circle is using me as little more than a servant and a pawn, a disgusting position for a man of my means and lineage. While I understand all the Circle has done for me and that its power is too great to oppose I cannot escape the desire inside me for self determination. For that I will need to not simply serve the Circle but rule it. It is this which set me on the course to master death. Death is a price for the unbearded, and nobility such as I should not be made to pay it. Our blood places us above the rest, and so we should be above judgment, even that of the gods. By demonstrating my ascendancy over life and death, by discovering my own road of immortality, I will have proven myself and must thus be allowed into the Circle. But I think the Circle knows of my plan. Somehow the Circle seems to know all I do, even here beneath the senate. Will it come for me, take me from my experiment? No, I will not permit it.”|

  
  

|   |

|3 Neth<br><br>  <br><br>“I can no longer bear the tedium and humiliation of my circumstance. I will not become a manifestation of the Senate writ small, dithering in uncertainty and cowardice until I die. The time has come. It must be today. I have memorized the ritual and put all my other notes and research to the flame. Now only I know the secret. The decades of research and service to the circle has taken much from me, but tonight I become the master of it all. What price is youth and happiness when I have found immortality? All of those things I lost I can have again. Tonight, I become Master of the Circle!”|

  
  

-Finally, the party receives another message from Martella. 

  

|   |

|“Pythareus rallied the guard, but the military seems divided. He was seen fighting the assassins, but the assassins seemed to be actively avoiding him. We are out of the senate building. Word of the attack and the emperor’s death has made it to the streets. Rosanna is in chaos. Lady Morilla is taking Eutropia to a secure location. I’m escorting the rest of the survivors to a safe house of mine. I will update you when I know the safe house is secure. Be safe until then.”|
