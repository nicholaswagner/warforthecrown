# Session 17 – Eros Glendower, Eternity in His Grasp – December 12, 2024 – Location: The Underground Senate

---

  

-As everyone settles in for a brief rest, the party takes an opportunity to connect with each other and with the nobles they’re escorting to safety. 

-Tirri gets to know Lady Urbane, a young woman with a passion for traveling and for documenting her explorations in travel journals. On a trip to the Riverlands several years past, she was kidnapped by pirates and ultimately rescued by Senator Manshum and Guy, and has been close to their family since. She confides in Tirri in that her family expects her to marry Guy, but she longs to travel independently, and believes that the overturning of primogeniture might allow her to do so. 
  

-Arturo offers the halfling servant Imostos Gulbend a position in his household, which Imostos receives awkwardly. He asks questions about particulars, but Arturo insists it can all be figured out later. Imostos promises to consider it. 
  

-Caritas talks with Ser Guy Vastienne and learns about his past. The Vastienne family were refugees from one of the Red Revolutions in Galt and fled their home when Guy was child. His parents died in the journey through the Brume Peaks, and the boy was discovered by Lord Mandshum, who took him in without question and raised him as his own son. ![[wanderer_thorn.png]]

  

-As the party sleeps, Tirri receives a dream visit from Wanderer Galen Thorne, who expresses relief at finding Tirri alive after hearing about the massacre in Rosanna. Both women express their sorrow for the way things went between them, and Wanderer Thorne insists that she’s traveling to Rosanna immediately. Tirri admits to her old mentor that she’s been feeling to pull of the Starsong lately, and she’s considering traveling the path again.

  

-The dream is interrupted when the party receives a message from Martella Lotheed.

|“I’ve reached my safe house. It should be safe for you to escape and join me. It’s located at the dign-” Martella’s message cuts off mid-word.|

  

-Concerned that danger has befallen their old friend, the party sets out with new determination to escape the underground. 

  

-Before setting out again, they resolve some small matters. Arturo returns the journal of Eros Glendower to Factor 12, and Rhenquist checks out the everlight crystal. Allister notices that Imostos Gulbend has pilfered a set of crystal glassware from a previous area of the senate, but decides to turn a blind eye on the halfling’s sticky fingers. 

  

-They find their road blocked by the door with chalk circles drawn on it (now in white streaks after Rhenquist smashed the bottle of whiskey on the door). The door has two locks. One of them is a fit for the key they obtained from Factor 12. The other requires another key. 

  

-Rhenquist leads the party back to the Seed Vault and to the gazebo with the symbol of Aroden. Inside, there is a statue with a broken off face, dressed in the traditional Azlanti garb associated with Aroden, the deceased God of Humanity. Two smaller statues flank either side, one of a woman with a cloak over her armor holding a staff covered in long-withered flowering vines, the other of a handsome man with a pair of outstretched angel wings, clad in armor and brandishing a sword. 

  

-As they approach, an apparition appears to them of a mustachioed man with bright green eyes and identical Azlanti robes to the statue.

|A voice like thunder rolled out of the vision. “I AM ARODEEN, GOD OF HUMANS! PAY TRIBUTE TO ME, MORTALS, OR FACE MY WRATH! YOU MAY PUT YOUR SACRIFICES OF GOLD IN THE DROP BOX TO THE LEFT!”|

  

-Arturo quickly deposits 5 gold pieces in the offering box, but some of the other party members are more skeptical. Allister asks for a demonstration of power, and the vision of “Arodeen” creates a swirling vortex of glitter from above. Unconvinced, the party discusses amongst themselves. Tirri points out that Aroden, not “Arodeen” was the god of humans; Allister notices that the apparition is sporting a mustache, not the trim goatee typically associated with Aroden’s style; and Rhenquist knows that the Azlanti people - with whom Aroden is closely associated - have purple eyes, not green. The party brings their evidence to the apparition, who sighs and finally reveals himself. 

  

-A short squat man with gray skin and a tunic hoists himself up from his hiding spot behind the gazebo. He introduces himself as Viecar, a creature from the First World who feeds on gold. Viecar tells them that King Dagio appointed him High Priest of the Underlevels. 

  

-Viecar has the key the party wants, but he insists they pay him in gold for it. Zarissa uses her contract negotiator experience to strike a bargain with him. In exchange for a modest sum, Viecar parts with the second key to the door, as well as “a bunch of useless stuff people put in his box) - a collection of gemstones and talismans. ![[viecar.png]]

  

-They party returns to the Circle Door and unlocks it to find a collapsed hallway beyond. Allister charges through the only visible door, causing further collapse as Allister is buried under falling rubble.

  

-Inside they find an old greeting room, currently occupied by an enterprising kobold named Mimips. Mimips explains that he ventured in through a sinkhole from the Underdark, and is trying to open his own alchemy shop to raise funds for his continued alchemical education. Excited at the prospect of selling to his first customers, he offers Gnomish Gooseberry Wine as he sets out his wares - wine on which Allister immediately gets drunk.  ![[red-dragon-ish.png]]

  

-The party takes the opportunity to purchase some potions and acid flasks from Mimips, who warns them about the haunted hallway outside of the room. 

  

-The party ventures forth into the haunted hallway, where they are immediately met by a time worn statue depicting a scepter-wielding man, marked with a bronze placard that reads “Eros Glendower - Eternity in His Grasp!”. Bloody circles drawing themselves on the walls, and a vision in the form of some sort of arcane echo of an event that happened in the past. 

  

-Through an open door they see a circular amphitheater, and the man depicted in the statue standing in the center, chanting an incantation from an open spellbook. His shouting becomes increasingly frantic as power surges around him, until it becomes clear he is losing control of the ritual. A large dire rat trembles in fear nearby as the crackling magic of the ritual overwhelms the man, culminating in an explosion of arcane energy that leaves nothing of the caster behind save for a clean silhouette on the floor, surrounded by streaks of black marks emanating out from the center. The dire rate looks around with newly intelligent eyes as he surveys the ruined aftermath of the ritual. 

  

-The vision fades, and the party ventures forth into that same circular chamber, where they hear the growing sound of dozens of chittering rats. In the center, an enormous dire rat sits on a makeshift throne, covered in painted circles and reading from a tome.

|The strange dire rat looked up from his book, serene, as though he had been expecting company. “I am King Dagio the Great,” he began. “Hierophant of the Arc, Archduke of Tangencies, the Beginning and the End. I knew someone was down here. The circles told me. I have been anticipating this.” Calmly, Dagio paced a ribbon bookmark and closed tome. “I see the paths that have led you here, circles within circles within circles within circles, intersecting, overlapping, interlocking. I can see that you cannot see all that I can see, which is to say - I’m sorry, but the immaculate circumference of your own existences must be terminated here. With your help, I can recreate the experiment which killed my master. I’m sure I can get it right,” he grinned with yellowed teeth. “With some trial and error, of course.”|
