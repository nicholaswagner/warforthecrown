# Session 9 - A Game of Inches - October 3, 2024 - Location: The Imperial Senate of the Glorian Empire

---

  

-Following Lady Martella’s meeting, the PCs split up to resume their projects. 

  

Round 4

  

-Zarissa resumes spying on High Strategos Pythareus, and eavesdrops on a conversation between him and Lady Nevanna Merosett, in which the High Strategos denounces the waste and ostentation of the event and expresses that the extravagant expenditures would be better sent to the military. 

  

-Allister continues pressing Duke Leonard Centimus for insight into his intentions with the vote, but the duke proves to be supremely stubborn and refuses to budge. Frustrated, Allister abandons the Imperial Archive in hope that he might have better luck again with Countess Pace. 

  

-Caritas continues to engage Baron Okerra in conversation, hoping to sway him to publicly support the Princess. The Baron is also a stubborn man, but Caritas finally breaks through his defenses by insisting that a clear line of succession will surely prove more stable than the chaos of a contest for the crown, and besides, it would do his daughter Selli good to see a woman in a position of authority. Convinced, the Baron thanks Caritas for his time and begins to inform the attendees of the Gala of his new position.

-Arturo finds Bartleby in the Courtyard and engages him in conversation, hoping to find evidence that Bartleby was involved with the plot to agitate the bees. Bartleby informs Arturo that his father Mercater died recently, and Bartleby is the newly anointed Count Lotheed. In the middle of the conversation, Arturo sees a young man with the purple brick walk through the Courtyard, and he abandons Count Lotheed to corner the culprit. 

  

-Rhenquist continues to needle Countess Pace, this time concocting a game to play with her. He informs her that he can read minds, and uses the Senate Aide badges to command his compatriots to follow his orders, which he then “predicts” for the Countess’s benefit. The Countess is amused, but is unwilling to show her cards without something in return. She offers to exchange a secret of hers for a secret of his.

-Tirri spends the round bringing Martella’s message to Count Orlundo Zespire in the Imperial Archives. The Count is studying a map of the canal system in Tandak Prefecture, and informs Tirri he is looking for a solution to a new plague of piracy that has sprung up in the area ever since Earl Calhadian Vernisant took power. Tirri suggests finding a way to use the natural landscape to the Count’s advantage, which he appreciates. Tirri wins the friendship of Count Zespire, and he begrudgingly accepts Martella’s mysterious request, though he warns Tirri that being involved with Martella might mean trouble. Nevertheless, he writes and seals another letter, and gives it to Tirri to deliver to Senator Amadorian Dou.

Round 5

  

-Zarissa grows bored of spying on the High Strategos and abandons her post to try to make more friends and allies in the Servant’s Area. She meets a friendly manager there, who expresses solidarity by slipping her a dose of antidote and warning her that death doesn’t usually come at swordpoint in the Senate. At her request, he brings her to the storage room holding the bottles and barrels of wine that had been pulled for the evening’s activities and leaves her alone to peruse them. Zarissa finds and identifies Bartleby’s bottle of rare Dauphenal Ice Wine from Nidal. 

  

-Allister returns to the Gallery to sew up his and Rhenquist’s efforts with Countess Abrielle Pace. After bantering with her for a bit, he offers to arrange for her to receive a shipment of rare and expensive textiles from Mwangi, and Countess pace finally relents.

|“If I can be frank, rumor is that it won’t matter whether primogeniture is overturned. It’s long been a goal of the princess. And while I support the idea, of course, the grand prince is never going to allow Eutropia to be Grand Princess. If it passes he’ll be legally obliged to recognize it, and then all he has to do is find someone at least a day her senior and adopt him. And she will never be Grand Princess. I don’t see why I should tie myself to a lame horse.”|

  

-Countess Pace advises Allister that, should he wish to make easy money after the succession, he should consider investing in weapons. She herself has already arranged several shipments from Irenkrag herself in anticipation of the Grand Prince adopting High Strategos Pythareus to be his heir. 

  

-Caritas takes on the burden of convincing Duke Centimus to spill his plans, and he finally does - the duke insists that he believes it to be wrong and offensive to measure a person’s ability by the reality of their body. Man or woman, human or halfling, abled or disabled, the Duke firmly believes that the heart and mind measures a person. He will be voting to overturn Primogeniture. 

  

-With that, the party has succeeded on Martella’s Discovery mission. 

  

-Arturo corners the chubby, stringy-haired nobleman carrying the purple brick of bee agitant, and tricks him into thinking that they are working for the same individual. Though the man does not give a specific name, he drops enough clues for Arturo to determine that Dame Malphine Trant is behind the evening’s shenanigans. The man hands the purple brick to Arturo, casually insults the Basris, and leaves. Arturo attempts to head off Dame Trant, but is too late.

  

-Rhenquist takes the opportunity he set up in the previous round to share his secret with Abrielle Pace. He informs her of Earl Vernisant’s dirty laundry, and the Countess hurries off gleefully to share this news with “everyone I know.” 

  

-Tirri delivers Count Zespire’s letter to the young and charismatic Senator Dou, who is holding court with his influential caucus of young senators. When he reads the Count’s letter, Senator Dou goes pale and tells Tirri that he’s received the message and of course the Count can rely on Senator Dou and his friends to vote to overturn primogeniture. 

  

-As Tirri is reconnecting with Martella (she gives her another letter to deliver to Lady Gloriana Morilla), she sees Dame Malphene Trant grab Senator Dou’s shoulder and steer him into the Beldam II Conference Room, flanked by several of her cronies. The PCs hurriedly discuss tactics, paralyzed with indecision until Rhenquist decides to imbibe one of the infiltrator’s elixirs, grab Tirri, and burst into the room under the guise of two lovers looking for a quiet place. 

  

-Dame Trant is standoffish and impolite, insisting that Rhenquist and Tirri are rudely interrupting a private conversation. They notice that her shortsword is not peace-bound, and when they refuse to leave, Dame Trant seems poised to make sure she gets her way - one way or another.
