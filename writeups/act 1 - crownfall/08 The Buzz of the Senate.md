### The Buzz of the Senate
Location: ==The Imperial Senate of the Glorian Empire==

- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]]t and the Dowager Duchess are approached by a woman who introduces herself as [[Copurnia Vau]], the Head Curator of the Arcade of Triumphs. Copernia confirms that the crossbow is a counterfeit of [[Dignity’s Barb]],  and gives them some history of the relic. It was wielded by General Gerefein of the Seventh Army of Exploration, and its most famous moment was when he used it to shoot a Kellid warlord through a raging blizzard, finding his mark and winning the day. The relic was probably put in storage in one of the many corridors and passageways underground, never to be found again. 


- The PCs move to the Courtyard for the Princess’s address. The Princess, dressed in dazzling attire bedecked with emeralds and sapphires, steps up onto a fountain ledge to give a speech to a huge audience. She introduces [[Kalbio of Breezy Creek]], the weaver being exalted tonight, and goes on to speak about the future of the Glorian Empire. 

  
> “My friends, colleagues, and assorted enemies, it is wonderful to see you all out in your finery beneath the beautiful stars tonight. With any luck, the weather will be the only thing that refuses to change this evening.
> 
> “We have all gathered here tonight to honor Master Kalbio of Breezy Creek, a master artisan and true patriot, for his exquisite skill and service to our glorious empire. Master Kalbio demonstrates so eloquently that a heart may be noble regardless of the stature of one’s birth, and while it may be premature, I hope to be the first to congratulate you, sir, on the exaltation you will see tonight and welcome you into the ranks of Glorian’s long-lived aristocracy.
> 
> “But we gather here to discuss matters of state, as well. And just as the exaltation reminds us that our glorious empire must always look out into the world to refresh the greatness of its leadership, we must all look out into the world around us and see how it has grown. The child-nations our empire birthed—Andoran, Cheliax, Lastwall—have grown strong by examining the great traditions they inherited from our motherland, and embracing those relevant to this new world and discarding those that held them back. So too will we, this very night, examine one of Glorian’s oldest traditions— primogeniture—with eyes wide open, to determine whether it has held us back from the glory and stability our wayward states have found.
> 
> “Our obligation tonight is not about one person or one vote in the senate. It is about the nation we love and about ensuring that nation does not fall behind the times. We are the inheritors of mighty Azlant, and I say that we must work together to avoid sharing that old empire’s fate. For Glorian!”

- As Eutropia is giving her speech in the Courtyard, Rhenquist, Caritas, Allister, and Tirri notice a servant girl break away from her group and make her way toward the apiary with a purple brick in her hand. Rhenquist hurries to intercept her and recognizes the brick as an alchemical substance which will agitate the bees and cause a disruption. He interrogates the servant, who says that one of the guards gave her the brick and told her to place it near the apiary, but she doesn’t remember any identifying information about the particular guard. Tirri takes her away to try to coax the information out of her, but she seems truly not to know. Thanks to Rhenquist’s fast action, the Princess was able to deliver her speech without interruption, and the PCs have 3 social rounds to try to make their influence.

#### Round 1

  
![[Countess Abrielle Pace.png]]

- [[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] tries to blend in at the Arcade of Triumphs so she can spy on High Strategos Pythareus, but she finds the task more difficult than she anticipated. Her tiefling heritage makes her stick out like a sore thumb, and she’s constantly accosted by people making rude and prying comments about her appearance and inquiring as to what she’s doing in the Senate tonight. 

  

- [[Tribune Ser Allister Hound]] begins to attempt to influence [[Countess Abrielle Pace]]. Through discussion with her he learns that she is cagey and duplicitous, difficult to pin down.

  

- Caritas begins to talk with [[Baron-Nicolaus-Okerra]], a handsome bear of man with a friendly and gentle smile. The Baron gives heartfelt condolences to Caritas for the loss of his father so many years ago, and admits that while he didn’t know the man personally, many of his colleagues have had many kind things to say about him. He shares his concerns about the vote to overturn primogeniture with Caritas - he is worried about the instability it would cause, especially because his young daughter Selli wants to become a knight, and he feels it’s his responsibility to give her as safe a world as possible. Caritas continues working to sway the Baron to Eutropia’s side. ![[okerra.png]]

- Arturo endures a tiresome conversation with the braggadocious and rude [[Earl Calhadian Vernisant]] , who informs him (between assertions that he has descended from General Arnisant himself) that a genealogical book is being held by Copernia Vau in the Arcade of Triumphs. Arturo goes to the Arcade and wins Copernia’s admiration with his genuine admiration of the artifacts on display. She brings him into the Artifact Restoration Room and gifts him a Superior Repair Kit. Arturo finds the book.   

  
![[library.png]]

- [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] finds [[Duke Leonard Centimus]] in the Imperial Archives, and through a conversation with the man about his duchy and the concerns and hardships the farmers there face, especially in the form of the crumbling infrastructure, he learns the Duke’s social weaknesses. The Duke is proud of the advancements he’s made to his wheelchair, and enjoys talking about the crafting of it. 

  

- [[Tirri-Kastner]] attempts to influence the Archives by perusing (and sharing her excitement over) several travel books which go into detail about the various exotic flora and fauna of the Verdigris Expanse, but she finds her enthusiasm is unreturned by the stuffy, bored nobles in the library. 

---

#### Round 2

-Zarissa continues to attempt to spy on the High Strategos, with no success. She finally leaves to find a quiet spot to imbibe the Infiltrator’s Elixir to give herself a better chance to go incognito. 

  
![[50cent.png]]

-Allister abandons Countess Pace to try to work on Duke Centimus. He talks to the Duke about his invention’s impact on his grandmother, and the Duke is delighted to hear it. He tells Allister that he is proud of his wheelchair and would rather spend the fortune it would cost to heal his affliction on creating and providing more chairs for people in need. It’s a very effective conversation, and Allister makes significant progress on Duke Centimus. 

  

-Caritas turns his attention to influencing the Senate Floor, and critically succeeds at the task. Word of his success spreads through the Senate Building, allowing the party to use Diplomacy to influence any room in the building. Additionally, a man named Baronet Dexterius awards Caritas a silver ring worth 30sp as a token of his admiration of Caritas’s abilities. 

  

-Arturo critically succeeds on his attempt to convince Copernia Vau to let him examine the book, and in doing so discovers that Earl Vernisant, while truly a descendant of General Arnisant, is also the descendant of a man who was dishonorably discharged from Lastwall for criminal misbehavior and banished back to the empire. It’s a humiliating scandal that will surely embarrass the Earl. This complete’s Martella’s “Theft” mission.

  

-Rhenquist engages in frothy conversation with Countess Pace, who is eager to talk with the young Merosett. He learns - much to Allister’s chagrin - that she has a penchant for fashion and for gossip. 

  

-Tirri returns to the gallery to try to influence the area with her dancing. She has some success, but she learns a hard lesson - kids are a tough crowd.

#### Round 3

  

- With the help of the Infiltrator’s Elixir, Tirri is finally able to find a spot to blend in in the Arcade of Triumphs. Her position secure, she begins spying on the High Strategos, who seems bored to be there. 

  

- Allister continues connecting with Duke Centimus, but runs into the same issue Martella complained about - the man is notoriously tight-lipped about his intentions with the vote, and he’s proving difficult to crack. 

  

- Caritas continues attempting to sway Baron Okerra to his side, but the stubborn man has little time for politics, and Caritas begins to lose the Baron’s attention, and his conversation. 

  

- Arturo sets down the purple alchemical brick in hopes of finding its source. A fat young nobleman picks it up and carries it away, handing it off to another man on the Senate Floor, but at this point, Arturo loses sight of the brick. 

  

- Rhenquist lures Countess Pace into a discussion about their positions on the vote, but neither party is willing to show their cards. 

  
> “If you show me yours, I’ll show you mine,” Countess Pace simpered.


> Rhenquist smirked. “Unfortunately for you, mine is peace-tied at the moment.”
  

- Tirri tries again to influence the Gallery. Though she begins earning the attention of the crowd, she’s not quite able to grasp the spotlight before she’s interrupted by [[Martella-Lotheed]]. 

---

  

- [[Martella-Lotheed]] contacts the PCs and asks them to meet her to debrief in a conference room over coffee. There, the PCs update everyone on their progress so far, and Martella encourages them to keep up the good work. 

  

- [[Martella-Lotheed]] reveals she did not ask them there just to badger them about their tasks. She has more to ask of them. A young new senator named Amadorian Dou is an easily swayed target. She believes she has him on Eutropia’s side, but she’d like to keep him there. One obstacle to that goal - Dame Malphene Trant, a bullying young noblewoman and daughter of the famously anti-Eutropia Senator Trant. Martella has learned that Dame Trant is in the building, and would like one or more of the PCs to keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn’t use her strong-arm tactics to intimidate [[Senator-Amadorian-Dou]]. 

  

- Martella also asks someone to deliver a letter to [[Count Orlundo Zespire]]. 

  

- Finally, Martella offers them a prototype of her silencing cricket, and she gives the party a [[The Brass Chatterbox]]. 

  

- The party and Martella continue catching up over coffee for a bit, and the PCs learn that the Princess is not aware of their presence in the Senate tonight. Martella believes the princess would not want to oblige her old friends to help her in her hour of need, and Martella would rather ask forgiveness than permission. With that, Martella leaves, and another round of politicking begins.
