# Session 15 – Wigging Out – November 14, 2024 – Location: Storage Rooms in the Senate

---

  

-Allister examines the strange fashions worn by the frozen figures and realizes that these are wax figures, dressed in the fashions of multiple different historical eras with very little cohesion between them.

-With the realization that nothing dangerous lurks in the unsettling room, most of the party returned to the Museum of Conquests to continue tending to their injuries and recovering from the brutal battle against the armor while Allister and Rhenquist continue exploring the wax figure storage room. 

  

-Among the wigs, Allister discovers one that is free of the years worth of dust caked on the others. Rhenquist recognizes the wig as a Masquerade Wig, a piece not uncommon among the fashion- and image-obsessed upper crust of the Empire. 

  

-One of the wax figures is knocked over on the ground, with circles carved into its face and exposed chest. The circles are geometrically perfect, but seem to have been carved with a less-than-perfectly sharp instrument.

-Zarissa hears a pitiful mewing sound in the Museum of Conquests and sets off to investigate. She finds a baby badger tangled up in a white leather leash with a Senate Badge on its collar. She rescues the badger and names him Periwinkle. 

  

-While the party is resting, they receive another message from Martella:

|“Not safe yet. Assassins stalking the senate halls. Ulfengaurd have withdrawn. The senate guard is nowhere to be seen - I fear the worst for them. The Ember Blades are not meant to stand against such an organized force, but Eutropia’s allies are reinforcing them. We’ve rendezvoused with some of Lady Morilla’s pathfinder society allies and we’re trying to get out now. Zespire went back to fight. Okerra is carrying the dowager duchess to safety.”|

  

-With renewed purpose, the Party decides to continue pursuing their escape from the underground Senate, but as they walk through the wax figure storage room, Allister feels a ticking at the back of his head, beneath the wig. He rips the wig off and throws it to the ground, revealing the Wig Ooze hiding inside.

-The Wig Ooze scuttles across the ground and leaps onto Caritas’s head, succeeding where it had previously failed, and successfully commandeering Caritas’s mind. Caritas falls into a haze of confusion and turns Provenance on his friends. 

  

-Rhenquist recognizes the Wig Ooze as a common pest, not dissimilar from a hermit crab. They live in old wigs and can be removed with physical force. He shares the information with the rest of the PCs, who promptly ignore him and start attacking the ooze indiscriminately over Allister’s protestations to protect the wig.

-A chaotic battle ensues as the party tries to attack the wig on Caritas’s head while dodging Caritas’s attacks. Rhenquist manages to trip Caritas, giving Arturo an opportunity to aim Dignity’s Barb at the ooze in point-blank range.

|With the help of Allister’s magic, Caritas found a moment’s freedom from the hold of the wig ooze, just in time to see Arturo pointing a crossbow at his head. <br><br>  <br><br>“Zespire, do you trust me?” Arturo asked. <br><br>  <br><br>“No!” Caritas shouted, but Arturo had already squeezed the trigger.|

  

-If anyone knows about hair, it’s Viscountess Tirri Caellio, and with a fling of her hairpins she finally separates the ooze from its home, freeing the Masquerade Wig from its unwelcome tenant. Allister reclaims the wig and returns it defiantly to his head as the party leaves the Wax Figure Storage Room. 

  

-The next chamber the party enters appears to be a storage room for banners, another pompous monument of Glorian military supremacy. One of the banner racks is knocked over, and the banners are covered in drawn circles with geometric notations. Arturo examines the circles, and though he can detect no rhyme or reason to the pattern of circles, he recognizes them as the work of a brilliant (if untrained) mathematical mind. 

  

-Out of the Banner Room, and through the Wax Figure Storage Room, the party finds another room full of displays, this time of various artifacts and relics of other cultures obtained during the various Movements. Among other items of significant value, Arturo finds a broken piece of an elven aiudara gateway, an item of great cultural significance to the elves of Kyonin. Caritas finds a broken Rysherin cold iron buckler in one of the displays, and Rhenquist barely stops him from opening the cabinet in time. Rhenquist reminds Caritas of what happened in the Museum of Conquests and suggests they take a moment to check the room for traps and other security measures. 

  

-Indeed, Rhenquist does notice a network of nearly invisible fibers woven into the glass and between the cabinet doors, which appear to attach to a leaf and vine patterned inlay across the floors and walls of the room. The party puts their heads together to figure out how to disarm the trap. Arturo, with guidance from Tirri and the help of Allister’s Loremaster’s Etude, deduces the effects of the trap - if triggered, deadly electricity will pulse through the chamber. He points out the runes etched into the wall, and everyone but Rhenquist and Allister leaves the room. 

  

-Allister offers his assistance as Rhenquist engages in the terrifying and delicate work of scratching out the runes without triggering them. Finally, Rhenquist declares the job (probably) done, grabs the cabinet, shuts his eyes, and pulls it open…to no effect. The trap was successfully disarmed. 

  

-The party takes the time to recover as many of the artifacts as they can carry, and proceed to the next room. 

  

-More dark and imposing shadowy figures are on display in this room, a grotesque and unsettling collection of ancient trophies in the form of taxidermied animals in various states of decay, including a dragonling hanging from the ceiling. Arturo notices that there are no circles in this room. Periwinkle shakes at the doorway, too scared to enter the room as Primrose poses inside a mechanical wolf’s mouth. 

  

-As the party is ready to leave, Imostos Gulbend accidentally leans on a lever, which begins the animatronic show. Screeching metal and shrieking gears fill the room with a metallic din as the animatronics fall apart. A huge griffon in the corner pulls itself free of the wooden frame holding it in place, losing a wing in the process before turning and attacking the nearest person to it - Tirri. 

  

-Tirri is immediately laid out by the wicked beak and talons of the mechanical griffon, and the party draws their weapons to fight yet another construct. Rhenquist has seen constructs like these before, a combination of artifice and primal magic which imbues the machines with a fragment of the animal’s original spirit, and, if not maintained, will allow the animal’s original nature to take over. The party faces an enraged and territorial griffon in a body made of metal, every bit as unyielding as the suits of armor. ![[dc703eb03c77044d035faa375fe97d96_MD5.png]]

  

-The PCs and the Griffon exchange blows until Zarissa flings her Needle Darts at the ropes holding the dragonling to the ceiling. The ropes snap and the taxidermied dragon crashes into the griffon, destroying the animatronic once and for all.
