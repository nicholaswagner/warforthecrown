# Session 13 – Walcofinde – October 30, 2024 – Location: Senator Voritas’s Safe Room, the Senate Underlevels

---

  

-In the wake of the massacre in the Senate, the PCs were teleported to a series of rooms belonging to the long-dead Senator Voritas - a series of rooms with no windows and no doors. The PCs grapple with their worries over the tragedy as they search for an escape. 

  

-Caritas brings the key her found in the comforter to the group in the Social Room and unlocks the locked liquor cabinet with it. Inside a glass orb protrudes from the wall with a missing piece in the center, and when Rhenquist slides in the glass piece he found in the hollowed out book, and the orb lights up. When they peer inside, they see the wall covered with crates. 

  

-Arturo and Caritas move the crates out of the way, finding in the process a set of thieves’ tools with 3 replacement picks, a healer’s kit, and a levered crowbar. They uncover a beautiful mosaic depicting a tall man in full plate with flowing blonde hair, eyes closed and head tilted as if listening deep underground, surrounded by evil looking dwarves with hammers and axes in the shadows of an underground cave.

-Arturo examines the mosaic and discovers that one of the stones is not truly a stone but a metal plate. The PCs try to open it manually but their efforts are frustrated. Finally, they take heed of the plaque beneath the mosaic and turn out the lights. In the darkness, Rhenquist peers through the orb and sees one of the stones on the mosaic lit up. The party communicates across the halls, touching the pattern Rhenquist observes, and the false stone pops open, revealing a small velvet bag of metal cylinders with the Voritas family crest on them. ![[man_resting_against_wall.png]]

  

-One by one, the PCs poke their cylinders into the eye of the tapestry unicorn and phase out of the Senator’s chambers. 

  

-They emerge into another hallway which proves to be a large rectangular room with a smaller rectangular room in the center. The walls of this hall are made of dark gray polished stone, and chiseled stone statues of Glorian Phalanx soldiers stand watch throughout the hall. A number of doors line the hallway, but the party immediately notices the dead body of a man in his sixties lying slumped against the wall, sporting huge bloody gashes across his chest and stomach. 

  

-Arturo examines the body and determines that the man is dead, but only very recently so - the body is still warm. He wears a signet ring on his finger depicting two roosters, which Arturo recognizes as the crest of Senator Viscount Devlin Manhsum. A fine sword with silver inlay in the black pommel lies by the body, as well as a coin purse with 217 sp and a rolled up parchment tied shut with a beautiful red ribbon. ![[wall-thing.png]]

  

-The rest of the party huddles around Manshum’s body, but Rhenquist backs away, realizing that whoever killed Senator Manshum may still be around. He is the only one who notices the wall behind Arturo begin to bulge out like a hand reaching through a curtain as a stone-pattern human figure begins to crawl out of the wall. 

  

-The party leaps into action. Rhenquist identifies this as a Walcofinde, an undead creature that manifests from the spirit of a poor soul buried within a wall. These are the creatures the tour guide spoke about to spook the group of teenagers, but apparently the Senate’s ghost stories are not all fiction. 

  

-Another and then yet another Walcofinde manifest from the walls, attacking the party. Zarissa and Tirri struggle as the creatures grab them and try to drag them into the walls to die. Rhenquist recalls that Walcofindes, like many undead, are vulnerable to healing magic, and Tirri channels the divine energy of the Wanderer to restore vitality to her friends while harming the attacking Walcofindes. Allister issues directives to his companions, giving them the insight and optimism to increase the brutal efficiency of their attacks, helping Arturo deal massive amounts of damage and Caritas to land several intimidating strikes, ultimately prevailing over the creatures and sending them retreating back into their cold and eternal coffins. 

  

-As the rest of the party tends to their wounds and recovers their focus, Rhenquist examines the scroll - papers of adoption, named Guy Vastienne as Senator Manshum’s heir. 

  

-One of the hallway doors creaks open and a young man in black and silver steps out cautiously, warning them about the monsters in the wall. The man introduces himself as Lord Wilfen Bothess, Senator Manshum’s nephew. He introduces his companions, Ser Guy Vastienne and Lady Angelle Urbane, all guests of his uncle the Senator.

-Guy hurries to Senator Manshum’s body, checking it frantically for any signs of life before covering the body with his cloak. He explains that he was Senator Manshum’s squire, though he was knighted last week. Arturo congratulates him on his adoption, which takes Guy and Wilfen completely by surprise - Guy becomes emotional, while Wilfen seems resentful. 

  

-Another door opens, and a tall man in Abadaran vestments emerges. He introduces himself as [[Archbanker Jowuan Zubari]].

-Archbanker Zubari offers to contribute his healing services to the efforts to escape from the underground at a discount. This annoys and infuriates Allister, who harbors resentment toward the Bank of Abadar to begin with, and Zarissa attempts to negotiate his fees away. The Archbanker ultimately agrees to provide his healing for free, if they promise to escort him and his companion to safety. They agree, and he calls out his companion - Malphene Trant. 

  

-Malphene emerges from the room, her gown bloody and her face wet with tears. She is bereft over her father, who died in front of her.

-Caritas breaks the tension when he lowers Provenance and tells Malphene that he saw she got a few good hits in as she struggles to gather herself. 

  

-The party hears a squeak and a crash from one of the other rooms, and they open the door to see a halfling man in servant’s livery cowering in the room. He introduces himself as Imostos Gulbend, a servant to Senator Morrain.

|“Were you harmed?” Zarissa asked, gesturing to the bloody tear in the side of Imostos’s uniform. <br><br>  <br><br>“Ah, yes ma’am. I did take a sword to the side. Luckily, I carried a number of potions for the Senator. I drank them all, and I feel much better now.”|

 ![[imostes.png]]

-Allister, still annoyed at Archbanker Zubari, grumbles about how much the PCs should be paid to escort these people. Ser Guy offers 10 gold for each member of his party if they escape the underground, and Imostos offers his best hankie, making Allister feel guilty. 

  

-The party explores the last room, a sitting room with a velvet-covered table strewn about with serving trays, fine sets of crystal glassware, and messy piles of papers. Arturo notices something odd under the table, and when he checks he finds dozens of chalk circles drawn onto the floor and under the table.

-Allister declines to pilfer the crystal sets, but does find a scroll of healing he adds to the party’s inventory. Tirri pushes the party to move forward, and Arturo begrudgingly leaves behind the strange circles. ![[display-cases.png]]

  

-The party moves through the remaining door, entering through a secret wall panel into an immense room. Dusty glass display cases stand along the walls, holding rusted and pocked suits of armor, tarnished and discolored weaponry, ammunition, letters, banners and standards all on display, labeled with little brass placards. Circles of various sizes have been scratched into the glass and drawn on the walls with chalk and paint, even apparently chewed into some of the fabric pieces in the display cases and hanging from the rafters. 

  

-Tirri casts detect magic and feels drawn toward a particular item: a gorgeous light crossbow carved of warm wood and golden brass detailing, displayed against a backdrop of crossbow bolts fanned out behind it. A golden lion mid-roar makes up the stock of the crossbow where it rests against the shoulder. Brass inlay and Glorian military symbols adorn the beautiful piece, and an inscription bears the name “General Gerefein, Seventh Army of Exploration”. Rhenquist identifies it as Dignity’s Barb, the true relic that was copied in the Arcade of Triumphs above. Allister backs away as Tirri opens the case to take the relic, his retreat stopped by a glass display case. The moment Tirri opens the door, a shrill screeching sound of metal grinding against metal shrieks through the Museum, followed by the crash of shattering glass and the Suit of Armor in the display case behind Allister punches through the glass with its gauntlet.
