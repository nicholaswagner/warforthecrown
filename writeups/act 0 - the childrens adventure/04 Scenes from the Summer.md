### Scenes from the Summer
 The Palace of Birdsong

---

  

-The children’s return creates pandemonium in the ballroom, and they are quickly spirited away to bedrooms in the Palace to be healed by Calistrian and Shelynite healers 

  

-Duchess Clement interrogates Allister, who tells a half-true story in which Martella accompanied them and Ser Gul Guisarne refused to respond to their calls for help. Duchess Clement considers whether she can blame Martella for the disruption. They are interrupted when Grand Prince Stavian enters the room, blaming Allister for his ruined party and for obstructing the crown’s justice. Duchess Clement asks whether the Grand Prince really feels threatened by a little boy, and then tries to turn the Grand Prince’s ire toward Count Lotheed. The Grand Prince leaves in a huff. 

  

-A drunk Uncle Gregario spends the night by Arturo’s bedside, holding his sick bucket and marveling over Arturo’s cleverness and bravery. 

  

-Lady Elara Kastner worries over the implications of the event, stressing the delicate nature of their social positioning to Tirri and agonizing over whether Tirri is learning the wrong lessons from Wanderer Thorne. 

  

-Nevanna Merosett briefly checks on Rhenquist but promptly leaves him to the healers’ care, insisting that the sight of blood makes her nauseous. Verlin cries outside Rhenquist’s door and falls asleep there, until she is woken by her mother’s return the next morning. Once Rhenquist assures her he feels alright, she gently scolds him for goading his brothers and informs him that he and his friends will have to be punished to assuage the Prince’s petulance. 

  

-The kids are assigned to do chores around the Palace for a few days, which seems to satisfy the Grand Prince. Meanwhile, Duchess Clement and Lady Kastner are engaged in a war over who should take the blame for the event.

-Tirri asks Caritas to practice shooting her crossbow with her. She expects Caritas to be able to help her, but it’s Caritas’s first experience with a crossbow, and he’s mostly delighted to play with it, causing a scene when he swings it wildly around. 

  

-Allister obtains a new Sapphire Butterfly pamphlet, and eagerly shares it with Arturo.

|“Read it quickly,” Allister urged. “I want to talk about all the details with you.”<br><br>“I’ll be finished in a few minutes,” Arturo insisted. <br><br>“Right then. I’ll wait here.”|

  

-A prank war is escalating among the children between Bartleby’s side of the house and the PCs’. Caritas fills Bartleby’s pockets with peacock feed, causing him to be chased by peacocks; Bartleby retaliates by lining Caritas’s clothes with itching powder. Tirri glitter bombs the twins’ bath, and the twins retaliate by cutting off Tirri’s hair while she sleeps. Arturo forges a letter from Princess Eutropia expressing her affection for Bartleby, and Bartleby gets stood up by the Princess when he arrives at the location. ![[bartleby_chased.png]]

-Madame Palponia informs the kids of the upcoming week of activities for Armasse, a celebration of Thaeodaen, the god of angels and paladins, and that the Grand Ball will feature the children dancing the Stellarza, a Rysherin dance that Caritas’s parents Rene and Madeira will demonstrate. 

  

-The children watch the husbands dance the Stellarza, a quick-paced waltz with tango-like elements of footwork including lots of heel and toe dragging. Furthermore, the Stellarza is traditionally performed in the dark, so the men dance blindfolded. 

  

-The children are told to pick their partners for the Stellarza. Caritas and Carrius pair up, as do Arturo and Tirri. Allister tries to avoid the obligation, and eventually the Duchess agrees to excuse him from the dance. Rhenquist asked Eutropia to be his partner, and she agrees after some awkward conversation.

-Caritas and Carrius practice riding and sneak around watching the military men train under the eye of Lansieur Commandant Maxillar Pythareus. At one point, Caritas overhears a conversation between Pythareus, Lady Kastner, and Pythareus’s advisor Milon Jeroth. Pythareus proposes a potential match between Tirri and an Earl he knows in Zimar, but Lady Kastner insists her daughter will make a love match and deftly turns the conversation to Pythareus’s own marriage prospects. Pythareus expects to marry Princess Eutropia once she’s made her debut (and Milon Jeroth makes lewd comments about when the princess will bleed).

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Let us hope the princess will have more endurance in childbearing than her mother did,” Jeroth sneered. “ The kingdom only narrowly avoided disaster last time.” |

-The boys respond by finding a suit of armor for Eutropia, to protect her from bleeding so that she won’t have to marry Pythareus. They bring the armor to her and explain their reasons, which leaves the Princess confused and troubled.

-Rhenquist is summoned to High Arcanist Duke Panivar Lotheed VII’s office. Duke Lotheed tells [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] that he believes a Glorian of true noble blood should be able to wield magic, and if their blood does not impart sorcerous power upon them, magic can be learned. He offers to take Rhenquist on as an apprentice in Rosanna and urges him to ask his grandfather’s permission. Excited by the prospect, Rhenquist spends several days bragging to his friends about his fortune. 

  

-When Rhenquist asks his mother’s permission, though, she expresses disappointment, and Rhenquist, eager for his mother’s approval, quickly changes his mind.

-Several days later, [[Count Cypristian Merosett]]  arrives at the Palace of Birdsong without fanfare, marches to find Duke Lotheed, and tells him off for making the offer of apprenticeship to his grandson. 

  

> “Engage in your machinations to your heart’s content, High Arcanist, but leave my family out of it. Next time you try to get your tentacles into the Merosett family, you will regret it.” - Count Cypristian Merosett


-Count Merosett pulls Rhenquist aside and explains the nature of his lack of magic to him. Once every few generations, the Merosetts give birth to an anchor, a child with no magic blood and who must never wield magic themselves. If Rhenquist learns magic, it will end the Merosett family’s sorcerous bloodline. Count Merosett expresses his sorrow that this misfortune has befallen Rhenquist, and explains that Rhenquist will have a life of absolute luxury, wanting for nothing, as long as he does the only thing the family will ever ask or expect of him - nothing at all.
