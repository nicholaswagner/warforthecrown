Six years after the Summer Without Rain, the PCs join the vast throng of mourners from across the continent in the Gilded City of Rosanna for the funeral procession of Prince Carrius, who tragically died at 16 years old after taking a fall from his horse. 

[[Caritas Zespire]] is asked to be one of the pall bearers. He will later learn that [[Princess Eutropia Stavian]] lobbied fiercely for this so that at least one person who truly loved Carrius could be at his side. 

  
The procession lasts many hours and travels throughout the entire city. In many ways, it’s a grotesque pantomime of grief by aristocrats hoping to increase their social capital by proving they are the most sorrowful over the death of the prince.

-Delegations from each of the 14 prefectures and provinces dump barrels full of expensive resources into the Mighty Porthmos in a show of solidarity with the Grand Prince’s suffering.

  

-The Grand Prince and Princess Eutropia ride in a carriage behind Carrius’s glass casket. The Grand Prince maintains an air of stoicism while the Princess quietly weeps. 

  

-At the end of the procession a black horse drags the body of Herog Svalskson, the Ulfen man assigned to be Carrius’s bodyguard. 

  

-Eventually, the procession arrives back at the Imperial Palace, and Carrius is transferred into the cold and lonely crypt beneath the castle. 

  

-The PCs grapple with the sad event. Rhenquist looks to his mother for cues on how to behave, and his sister Verlin tells him that through her correspondence with Eutropia she knows that she is betrothed to Lansier Commandant Maxillar Pythareus, but the wedding, already delayed until after her schooling, might be further postponed. Zarissa scans the crowd for Martella, who in turn scans the procession for Eutropia. Allister looks everywhere but the procession, evaluating the sincerity - or lack thereof - of the aristocrats in attendance. Arturo and Tirri struggle with the knowledge that this display is so far from what Carrius would have wanted. 

  

-The funeral ends, and the sun sets on the Empire. 

  

-Shortly after the funeral, Princess Eutropia breaks off her engagement to Maxillar Pythareus, publicly humiliating the Commandant and cementing a future of estrangement from her father the Grand Prince.

-Zarissa’s patron, The Lady of the Weeping Wail, gifted her a dark egg. “A creature made from spit and spite, which needs a blot of blood to bind you.” Zarissa let three drops of her own blood spatter onto the egg, which hatched into her Familiar of Ongoing Misery - a suicidal possum-like creature with three blots of blood on its face which Zarissa affectionately names Primrose. 

  

-Primrose is hostile towards everyone and particularly violent towards men. Primrose also finds a new and creative way to die nearly every day. 

  

-A few years after Carrius’s funeral, Zarissa’s mother develops a shaking illness, and is quickly and unceremoniously sacked from the Lotheed household by Countess Lotheed. The Nocturne family is unable to find stable work for many years, largely because she is shunned by the Glorian high society for her tiefling heritage, and Zarissa is forced to scrabble to make ends meet. ![[castle_on_waterfalls.png]]

  

-Years later, Zarissa receives an invitation to Winduing Castle in Krearis Prefecture, the home to Grand Duke Borund Heskillar. There she meets Liomtraud Heskillar, the Grand Duke’s new wife, the Grand Duchess Heskillar, a dwarf. 

  

-The Grand Duchess is visibly nervous and conducts a strange interview. She reveals that she has had trouble hiring staff because Glorian society has not been welcoming to her given her dwarven heritage. She also reveals that she received a letter from Princess Eutropia, recommending Zarissa for the position of Lady’s Maid. 

  

-Zarissa accepts the offer to become the Grand Duchess’s Lady’s Maid, but mentions that she will need a place for her mother and sister to live. Grand Duchess Heskillar offers to let Zarissa’s mother live in the Dower House.

|“That’s very generous. Are you sure it isn’t putting you out?”<br><br>  <br><br>“Oh, no,” the Grand Duchess smiled kindly. “I expect your mother will die long before my husband does!”|

-One year after the funeral, Caritas and his father Rene rest after a practice duel. Rene talks to Caritas about his dueling sword Provenance, given to him by the Lord Protector of Rysher in the Riverlands, and promises that they will travel to Rene’s homeland so that Caritas can learn the Rysherin Dueling Sword as well.

|“In Rysher we believe that every man must keep his eyes to the sky and always chase the sun.”|

  
  

-Madeira’s valet comes out to inform him of something, and Maderia follows him into the house. When he comes back out, he is followed by a pair of your father’s colleagues in the Phalanx. Rene goes to meet them, and one of the men apologetically puts Rene in manacles and leads him away. The man who shackles Rene is visibly unhappy about having to arrest him, and Rene places his shackled hands on his shoulder to comfort him as he's led away.

  

-Madeira’s uncle Orlundo comes to their home in Zimar, and Caritas pieces together the situation. Rene is being accused of stealing supplies and provisions from the Phalanx and giving them to Qadirans, a crime which carries the punishment of banishment. Rene insists on submitting to truth serum. Orlundo advises Maderia to prepare his family to move out of the Empire and to Rysher. 

  

-On the day of the trial, Caritas takes stock of the raised platform where his father will stand trial. It is bedecked in purple fabrics. Seated in the position of judge is Inquisitor General Feradica Torcamay, a red-haired aasimar woman limned in golden light; Earl Yander Merkondus, a rat-faced noble with a golden cane and a heavy limp; and a familiar face as well - that of Milon Jeroth. ![[general_feradica_torcamay.png]]

-Rene du Valle is led out in his military uniform. He drinks the truth serum publicly, and at Earl Merkondus’s questioning, he confesses to the crime of theft and smuggling, but denies breaking his oath. ![[earl_yander_merkondus.png]]

“I have distributed food and healing potions to the neediest among us, women, children, the elderly and infirm. These were desperate people, many of whom were innocent victims of our own Empire’s aggressions. I have never offered aid or succor to any able-bodied Qadiran soldier, and I never would. I swore an oath to protect this Empire from all her enemies, and any who would threaten the safety and wellbeing of her people. I would die before I broke that oath, and I testify today, under the effects of truth serum, that I have not broken that oath.”
  

-[[Earl Yander Merkondus]] consults with [[Milon Jeroth]]. Inquisitor General Torcamay looks disappointed as she announced the penalty for these crimes is discharge and banishment. Merkondus returns and says he’s not quite finished. 

“Your words regarding your oath inspire us all, Commander du Valle. You say that you have never broken that oath. Since the day you took that oath, has it always been your intention to…what was it… protect this Empire from all her enemies, and any who would threaten the safety and wellbeing of her people?”  

“Yes,” Rene said. “With all my soul and self.” 

Earl Merkondus smirked. “Just one more question, then. Have you ever expressed, in a private conversation at the Sword & Steed tavern that, having spent time in his company during the Summer Without Rain, you believed His Imperial Majesty Grand Prince Stavian III may be himself a threat to the empire in his - quote - diminished state of paranoia and madness?”


-Stunned silence in the courtyard. Rene decides to take this opportunity to speak directly to his family. 


> “Caritas, listen to me,” Rene shouted from the platform. “You are my favorite person. As long as Provenance is by your side, so will I be. And keep your eyes to the sky, Caritas, and never stop chasing the sun. There has never been a father more proud of his son.”

  
“Answer the question, Ser du Valle!” 

  
> “Madeira, don’t be afraid. In every life, I will always find you. Please don’t look away. Let your face be the last thing I see before I go.”


“Ser de Valle, did you say it!”

  

> “Yes. I said it. Yes.”
  
![[caritas_watching_father_killed.png]]

 [[Count Orlundo Zespire | Uncle Orlundo]] undo tries to shield Caritas’s eyes, but Caritas resists, and watches as his father, mouthing comforting words to Madeira, is beheaded by Inquisitor General Torcamay’s sword. 

  
Unrest breaks out in the dismayed crowd, and Orlundo hurries the Zespires out of the scene. As he leaves, Caritas looks up at Abadar’s Pillar and sees the newly anointed High Strategos Maxillar Pythaerus watching hawkishly from a balcony.

  

A few days after the funeral, a mysterious mourner arrives for Caritas, and reveals herself to be Princess Eutropia. She stays to comfort Caritas and share in his moment of grief. 

  
![[provenence_from_attachments.png]]

The Zespires endure an invasive public investigation, and the loss and humiliation leave Madeira a shadow of the man he was before. He never plays the cello again. The Zespires’ vineyards are vandalized and there is little appetite from the ruling nobles to investigate, so only a string of miracles and the heroics of Count Orlundo save the family’s fortunes and reputation. 

  
-After the execution, when Caritas unsheathes Provenance, the steel is smooth, and all of the runes - a lifetime of Rene’s experiences and accomplishments - are wiped away.

-Rhenquist is in a foul mood after a deal he worked on for weeks fell through at the last minute. He takes out his annoyance on his cousin Lens, who is hungover and sleeping on the couch in Rhenquist’s bedroom, and they bicker until Rhenquist’s sister Verlin comes to say goodbye before she departs for the Observatory Arcanis to study star magic. 

  

-The siblings play one last game of Emperor’s Conquest before Verlin suggests that Rhenquist and Lens might consider escorting her to Irrisen. Rhenquist seizes on the idea and agrees to accompany her across the continent. ![[rhen_and_lens_and_irrisen.png]]

  

-The trio get into lots of fun trouble on the trek across Avistan. At one point in Northern Tandak, before they’ve even left the Empire, Rhenquist forges an invitation to the Hearts and Flowers Ball thrown by the new Earl Basri. They’re surprised to meet Arturo there, who informs Rhenquist of his uncle’s passing. They share a long night of drinking before the Merosetts depart in the morning. 

  

-In Irrisen, the time has come to say goodbye, and Verlin pointedly asks where she should write. Rhenquist and Lens agree that no one would miss them at Frostone Hall, and decide to continue their travels. The pair spend the next several years traveling across Avistan and beyond, and Rhenquist’s love and appreciation for the history and culture of Glorian grows. 

  

-20 years after the Summer Without Rain, Rhenquist, back at Frostone Hall, is summoned by his grandfather the Count, who asks (somewhat insincerely) if Rhenquist feels overlooked by his grandfather. He goes on to talk about his new familiar, a snow fox, and how the Count has a habit of leaving the door open at night to see whether the little familiar will seize the opportunity to leave.

  

-That evening at dinner, Cypristian III is droning on about his thoughts for the upcoming vote on the repeal of Primogeniture, at which he assumes that he will be appointed to serve as the Count’s proxy in the Senate. The Count announces that he should share his thoughts with Rhenquist, as that is who the Count has chosen to represent him in Rosanna this year. Disbelief and pandemonium break out at the dinner table after the Count retires, as Rhenquist laughs and his mother smirks into her cup. 

---

  

-Arturo’s family is adjusting to the new reality of Tio Gregario’s death. His father Benecio is the new Earl Basri, but in the chaos and confusion Arturo is throwing himself into a different focus - investigating the sudden and suspicious circumstances surrounding Gregario’s death. 

  

-A shipment of 30 vials of an alchemical substance arrive at the doorstep, and Arturo identifies them as Potions of Sleeplessness, which make the drinker unable to sleep but does not provide the effects of rest. The next month, another shipment arrives, but no further shipments arrive after that. 

  

-Later, in the library, Arturo remembers the secret office he discovered during the Summer Without Rain. When he goes into the office, he notices blots of ink on the desk, and when he opens an encyclopedia volume on the desk, he sees dozens of black circles scrawled on every page. 

  

-Investigating further, Arturo pulls book after book after book off the shelves, each one covered in the strange obsessive circles. With dozens of books spread out on the floor, he finally recognizes a pattern - the strange circles form letters, of a sort, which spell out the word “Thassritoum”

---

-Tirri spends the years after the Summer Without Rain struggling to walk the tightrope balance between her mother’s expectations of Tirri as a young lady in society and Wanderer Galen Thorne’s expectations of her as a budding cleric of the Wanderer. ![[tirri_performing.png]]

  

-She attends the Kitharodian Academy in Rosanna, where she studies dance. During  performance run of a ballet Tirri is starring in, a young man - later identified as Viscount Talvin Caellio - catches her eye, returning night after night to watch her performance until he finally works up the nerve to approach her on closing night. He offers her a bouquet of flowers, introduces himself, thanks her for the dance, and says “I have never seen anything more beautiful.” 

  

-They court and fall in love, and their relationship becomes a proxy war between Lady Kastner and Wanderer Thorne, who begs Tirri not to marry the Viscount, because settling down and starting a family will make it impossible for her to travel and explore as The Wanderer calls her to do. Tirri insists on marrying the Viscount, and a rift opens between her and her mentor. 

  

-All of the PCs except Zarissa attend Tirri’s wedding, which earns its reputation as the social event of the season. It’s an elaborate affair, with beautiful exotic foods, raining flower petals, and flowing liquor. ![[tirri_wedding.png]]

  

Allister is posted by the bar when he’s approached by a handsome Aiuvaran man who introduces himself as [[Lucien Alcier]]. Lucien and Allister flirt aggressively - Lucien identifies himself as the adopted son of the Ambassador from Kyonin, and the idle rich. He asks Allister to “help find [his] dance card” in the cloakroom, and they make their way there, emerging quite some time later having not found his coat. 

  
![[lucien_and_allister_punch_dance_card.png]]

-Tirri, the new Viscount Caellio, goes on to have three children: Barrett, Maylin, and Aric. By the time she receives Martella’s letter, the children are all away at boarding school, and Tirri is glad to receive something that might bring a bit of excitement to her life.

-In Rosanna, as Exaltation Day approaches, Allister and Lucien are hanging out in the Clements’ apartment in Aroden’s View. They are bickering over which parties to attend in the crowded social calendar of the Exaltation when there is a knock at the door. Lucien gets dressed and answers the door on his way out, greeting the Clement family, who have arrived for the Exaltation Gala. 

  

-The Dowager Duchess Clement teases Allister about his relationship with Lucien, until the Duke changes the topic to business. Allister’s attempts to establish a shipping lane with Andoran have not been successful yet, and the books are suffering for it. The Duke tells Allister that they will either need to finally establish the shipping route, or else they will have to cut their expenditures. He suggests looking into cutting off the Dowager Duchess’s exotic flower shipments from Mwangi, against his mother’s protestations. Regardless, Duke Clement tells Allister it’s up to him to make the decisions, and the Dowager Duchess makes a last plea to Allister to leave her flowers alone before going into her room to get dressed for the Exaltation Day festivities.
