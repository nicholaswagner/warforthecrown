### The Summer Without Rain
Various Locations Across the Glorian Empire

---

Six white doves are dispatched from the Glorian capital city of Rosanna in the late summer of 4718. They each carry a letter to a different recipient across the nation, and each of the PCs receive the following missive

  
> My dearest friend
> 
>I hope this letter finds you healthy and well, and that you will forgive me for its abruptness. I know it has been many years since last we spoke. Please do not misinterpret that as disinterest in you or in your life. Though time, travel, and obligation may have kept miles between us, know that I have kept our friendship close to my heart, and have followed your trials and triumphs from afar. My thoughts have ever been near to you, my friend. 
>
>Of the many projects which have kept me occupied, perhaps none have been so consuming or so significant as the one which lies now before us. As you have no doubt heard, the Senate is poised to vote on Revision Stroke Fourteen on Imperial Edict Five Hundred and Twenty Four - to amend the law of primogeniture, allowing women to directly inherit and paving the way for the Princess Eutropia to ascend the Lion Throne of the Glorian Empire. That this vote is even being considered represents the culmination of years of hard work and will shape our nation for centuries to come. 
>
>The world today is not as simple as it seemed all those years ago during the Summer Without Rain. I have learned how far the world expands beyond the walls of the Palace of Birdsong, and how dire are the problems it faces. We stand now at an inflection point for our empire and for the world, and with your aid, I believe that we can do real good and make real change for this kingdom that we love. 
>
>And so I write to you to ask you the same question I posed to you the very night we first met, in the earnest hope that you will deliver the same response as you did all those years ago.
>
>The princess needs you. Will you answer her call
>
>Martella Lotheed

  
  The letter is accompanied by a reservation card for The Preening Peacock on the 24th of Arodus. The contents of the letter and the signatory remind the PCs of a person and a summer twenty years ago, in 4698, the Summer Without Rain

-Allister Hound, an orphan from the neighboring nation of Andoran, watches from a classroom window in Cassomir, a damp and mildewed port city in Tandak Prefecture, as a noblewoman arrives at the Temple of Abadar. Allister is called out of class to the Temple, where he is informed that he’s being adopted by The Dowager Duchess Maraji Clement. 

-When the Archbanker informs the Duchess that the amount she sent ahead was insufficient, she relinquishes her cane to complete payment. 


-Allister gathers his things and helps escort the Duchess back to her opulent carriage, where she introduces herself and tells Allister that she was friends with his parents. They make awkward small talk, and the Duchess informs him that they are en route to spend the summer at the nearby Palace of Birdsong at the Grand Prince’s invitation. She offers him a pamphlet on The Sapphire Butterfly, a vigilante hero, and the majority of the rest of the ride is in silence. 

  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| “You gave up your cane.” “I can buy another one.” Allister counted out the three copper pieces he had managed to save up during his years at the orphanage. “Is this enough?”  The Duchess studied him for a moment, then held out her hand. “Yes,” she smiled warmly as he handed her his coppers. “I believe this will buy a very fine cane indeed.” |

  

-At one point, they pass by a black castle, and the Duchess explains that this is Bastion Saintbor, home to an order of Hellknights, a type of knight that tyrannically enforces their code of laws and ethics on everyone and considers themselves above any law or oversight. She assures Allister that they are going to a much nicer place than this. 

  

-As they arrive at the Palace of Birdsong, Duchess Clement notices that the Kastners’ carriage is also arriving.

|                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Lady Kastner is coming? Clever woman…I wonder how she managed to secure an invitation.” |

![[tirri_as_a_child.png]]

-Tirri Kastner is traveling with her mentor, Wanderer Galen Thorne, a cleric of the Great Dreamer, through the Brume Peaks in the northernmost reach of the Empire. They have been traveling for weeks.

  

-Wanderer Galen has a strange and excitable energy tonight, unusual for the typically sleepy Wanderer. She informs Tirri that she can feel something close by, something that Elodin wants them to see. She warns Tirri that though they have kept to the safest roads through the Brume Peaks so far, they will have to wander off the path in order to find what the Dreamer wants to show them. Is she willing to go into danger? 

  

-Wanderer Galen takes off into the fog, and though Tirri tries to follow her, she loses her way in the thick fog. As fear and fog presses in around her, Tirri hears the clopping of hooves and the rattling of chains. She stumbles through the clearing hide behind a tree, and hears two voices discussing what appears to be a human trafficking exchange. Wanderer Galen finds her and pulls her away from the scene, but not before Tirri notices a pair of bright golden eyes watching her through the fog. 

  

-Eventually, they find another clearing, this one free of fog and with a sleeping woman on a bower in the middle.

|“A Dream Guardian!” Wanderer Galen whispered. “A saint of the Wanderer, chosen and blessed. Oh to know of her dreams! To follow in her steps! We have been so dearly blessed to find her, Tirri! Come, we will sleep safely tonight under her watch.”|

  

-When Tirri wakes the next morning, the clearing and the slumbering woman inside are gone, and the Wanderer tells her it’s time to teleport home. 

  

-When they arrive back in the courtyard, Tirri’s mother Lady Elara Kastner is furious that they are late to leave for the Palace of Birdsong. She sends Tirri to clean up and get ready to leave immediately, and Tirri sees her and Wanderer Thorne in a heated discussion about their tardiness before loading into the carriage and setting off.

![[child_caritas_with_wooden_sword.png]]

Caritas Zespire is fighting a dragon in his living room, a wooden sword in one hand and a pillow/shield in his other. Caritas is trying to remember his battle stances so as to slay the draconic intruder. 
  
“Sword stance four!” The dragon sneered, blowing out curling tendrils of black smoke. “You fool! You have left your right side vulnerable to my mighty claws!”

Caritas narrowly evades a blast of Dragonfire, but the attack sends his sword and shield skittering across the room as he crashes into the bar cart, nearly destroying his father’s crystal decanter. 


The dragon lunges to finish Caritas off, but Caritas finds a silver serving tray, and cleverly uses it as a shield. The Dragon smashes into the tray, denting it.

Caritas’s father Madeira Zespire abruptly stops playing his cello and chastises his son and his husband René for ruining his silver tray, ending the game of make-believe.

Madeira’s Dragon Slaying Soundtrack
![[qrcode-dragon-slaying-playlist.png| 100]]

-Maderia’s lecture is cut short by a frantic knock at the door. René answers it to see one of his lieutenants with a Qadiran woman in rags and her terrified child. Caritas notices a brand of some kind on both the woman and her child’s arm. The lieutenant explains that the woman showed up at the border alone and it was all he could do to get them to the Zespire’s home without attracting notice. 

  

-René begins conversing with the woman in Kelesh, and then tells Caritas to go to bed. Caritas tries to sneak in to eavesdrop, but gets caught. The next morning, the family departs to spend the summer at the Palace of Birdsong, but when he goes back to retrieve his backup sword, Caritas learns that the little boy will be staying in Caritas’s bedroom while they are gone.

-In the Empire’s Edge Mountains, in the shadow of Frostone Hall, Rhenquist Merosett and the rest of his family are locked in a brutal game of Basilisk. Rhenquist plays his usual position of Shield, while his cousin and best friend Lens Hill plays his offensive counterpart of Striker. Rhenquist’s mother is Caller for his team, while his uncle Cypristian II is Caller for their opponents. ![[child_adventure_rhenquist.png]]

  

-Rhenquist manages a few great plays, intercepting the Basilisk Ball several times before he’s finally frozen by his cousin Stis. Just as the horn blows, announcing victory for Rhenquist’s team, his brother Fendren plows into his frozen body from behind, breaking Rehnquist’s nose.

|“Oops.” - Fendren Merosett|

  

-Rhenquist’s mother frees him from the Basilisk’s spell and praises him for playing well, then tells him there won’t be time to call a healer up for his nose before they have to leave for The Palace of Birdsong. She sends him up to get cleaned up and dressed. 

  

-As the servants fuss over him, Rhenquist has a conversation with his cousin Lens about how unfair it is that Lens can’t accompany them for the summer because Lens is a bastard. They come up with a scheme to hide Lens under a blanket, but when the family is finally all gathered and ready to teleport away, Count Cypristian Merosett arrives to see them off, and tells Lens to get out from under the blanket. The two cousins share a tearful goodbye, and Rhenquist accompanies his little sister Verlin through the teleportation circle.

-Arturo Basri has noticed something odd in his Uncle Gregario’s library. An unusual smell wafts faintly through the air, like perfume, but not his aunt’s. Arturo follows the smell to the most boring part of the library. ![[child_adventure_arturo_1.png]]

  
> I hate this section, Arturo mused. Not an almanac in sight…
  
-Arturo examines the floor in front of a bookcase and discovers fading footprints and faint scratches in an arc extending from the wall. When he studies the books on the shelves - a collection of Elvish history written in Elvish, no pictures - he notices one that stands out as a fake. When he pulls the book off the shelf, it triggers an unlocking mechanism, and the bookcase pops out of the wall.



-Inside, [[Arturo Basri]] finds a secret hidden study, with more bookshelves on the walls and a wooden desk covered in correspondence, mostly written in Elvish. He notices a piece of pink fabric sticking out of a drawer, and pulls out an embroidered perfumed handkerchief - the source of the mysterious smell. 

  

-Before he can examine it any more closely, his Uncle Gregario sneaks in behind him, catching him by surprise. Furious, Uncle Gregario marches him down to the parlor to talk with Arturo’s father. They discuss possible punishments for Arturo’s sneaking and lying, from a summer without desserts all the way to banishment to Diabolical Cheliax. 

  
> “I am so ashamed of this liar and sneak, Gregario,” Benecio Basri lamented. “What shall I do with him? Punish him for the summer? Send him directly to bed every night with no dessert?”

  

> “Not the flan!” Arturo squeaked, terrified.
  
![[arturo_as_an_adult.png]]

-As Arturo begins to panic, the two brothers start laughing, and Gregario apologizes for his little joke. To make it up to Arturo, his uncle suggests Arturo accompany him to the Palace of Birdsong for the summer. Arturo notices that his uncle does not hand the handkerchief to the servants to be washed and returned to his aunt, but shoves it in his pocket instead.

![[child_adventure_zarissa.png]]

-In the Countess Lotheed’s dressing room at The Palace of Birdsong, Zarissa Nocturne’s mother is doing her hair as Zarissa animatedly describes her day so far. There is a lot of excitement and tension in the air at Birdsong Palace because of the arrival of the Grand Prince and his guests, but Zarissa is mostly excited about a pointy-eared squirrel she saw out the window today. 

  

-A crash outside the door to the dressing room is followed by a string of harsh words. The Countess bursts into the room, frantic over a freshly blooming bruise on her cheek. Outside the door, a terrified little girl sits among the ruins of a broken porcelain bust. Zarissa’s mother asks her to go help clean up outside the door and she works to conceal the Countess’s injury. 

  
  
![[child_adventure_martella.png]]

-The little girl introduces herself as [[Martella-Lotheed]], and even though Zarissa has never met the girl before, she recognizes the name. Martella is the half-Qadiran bastard daughter of Count Lotheed, and the target of the Countess’s most violent wrath. 

  

-As Zarissa’s mother finishes, Martella thanks Zarissa for her help, then darts away before the Countess can see her again. The Countess emerges looking completely unscathed, and Zarissa’s mother calls her back in. 

  
  


“We must help our sisters wherever we can. Even the ones we don’t like very much.” Zarissa’s mother’s voice darkened. “Especially when it’s a man’s hand that causes them suffering.”

  

-Her mother also explains that the Grand Prince is coming, and many other noble men and women, and that it’s very important that Zarissa stay out of sight and not cause any trouble or do anything to attract notice - especially from the Grand Prince or the Count and Countess. She hands Zarissa a packet of herbs and asks her to deliver them to the cook and let him know it is a gift for Count Lotheed. Zarissa agrees and heads to the kitchen, and is only just able to hand over the packet when the serving staff explodes with anxiety at the arrival of the Grand Prince’s noble guests.

![[palace_of_birdsong.png]]

-The PCs meet for the first time at [[The Palace of Birdsong]], briefly introducing themselves to each other before Rhenquist is summoned to the sitting room to wait for a healer to arrive to fix his nose. He takes his little sister Verlin to wait with him, and they play a game of Emperor’s Conquest until Banker Paril arrives to set his nose, explaining that it might hurt for a while longer. 

  

-Everyone is drawn back out to the courtyard as the Grand Prince’s retinue arrives. Out of an elaborate carriage steps the Royal Family - Grand Prince Stavian III, the Dauphin Prince Carrius, and the Princess Eutropia.

[[Grand Prince Stavian III]]

  
The Grand Prince greets his hosts and guests briefly, then is escorted inside. Princess Eutropia introduces herself and her younger brother Carrius to the PCs, but their introduction is interrupted by a parade of magnificent desserts which passes tantalizingly in front of the children before continuing their journey down to the kitchens. Eutropia explains that the desserts aren’t for them, they’re for the ball tomorrow, which none of them will be allowed to attend because they have not made their society debuts. 

Everyone sits down for a pleasant dinner, and then the children are escorted to the guest house where they will be staying for the summer. Just as they are about to fall asleep, a knock on their bedroom door wakes each of the children in turn. Martella Lotheed delivers a message to them. 


> “The princess needs you,” Martella whispered in the quiet of the night. “Will you heed her call?”  


Martella ushers each of the pajama’d PCs to her bedroom, where Eutropia and Carrius are waiting. Eutropia explains that she believes it’s unjust that they should be denied access to the desserts that were flaunted in front of them earlier today just because they’re too young, and declares that it is her intention - with the help of the PCs - to break into the kitchen and steal desserts.
