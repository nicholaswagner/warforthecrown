---

#### The Plan
- The children all congregate in Martella’s bedroom in the guest house, along with Prince Carrius’s body guard, an Ulfen Man named [[Herog Svalkson]], who is minding his own business and knitting.
- [[Princess Eutropia Stavian]] suggests they break into three teams:
- [[Martella-Lotheed]] will lead one team into the servants’ quarters to steal the kitchen key
- [[Prince Carrius Stavian]] will lead one team across the garden to open the trapdoor in the ballroom
- [[Princess Eutropia Stavian]] will lead one team through the palace to get the goods

---

#### Team Key

- [[Martella-Lotheed]], [[Tribune Ser Allister Hound]], and [[Dame Zarissa Nocturne]] head to the servant’s building. As they approach the building they overhear/spy on a conversation between [[Count Bartleby Lotheed]], [[Fendren Merosett]], and [[Caldadis Merosett]], in which the twin Merosetts make fun of Rhenquist, calling him a runt and explaining that they call him that because he is “Runoff” - a Merosett born with no magical blood. 
- The kids connect over Martella’s interest in mechanical tinkering and Zarissa’s interest in embroidery, and they talk about Allister’s recent adoption. 
- They conquer squeaky floors, a vicious chihuahua guard dog, and the sleeping cook and successfully filch the key.

#### Team Garden

- [[Prince Carrius Stavian]], [[Caritas Zespire]], and [[Arturo Basri]] head across the garden. The garden is active and well-lit, swarming with wandering Ulfen Guard, scheming nobles, and aggressive peacocks. At one point, they overhear a contentious conversation between [[Vice Count Rene Malbec du Valle]] and [[Dutchess Clament]], in which Rene asks for the Duchess’s help, and she castigates him for “innuendo and accusations” before ending their conversation with a threat. 


> 
> And let me make myself perfectly clear, in case the Glorian art of subtlety finds itself lost upon your Rysherin ears. If my name ever finds itself sharing your mouth with slanderous innuendo and treacherous accusations like the ones which you belched out tonight, something unpleasant *shall* befall you.
> 
> - Duchess Clement, who has absolutely nothing to hide

- The boys bond over Arturo’s love of books and interesting plants, Carrius’s love of horse riding, and Caritas’s love of swordplay and devotion to his father. 
- They overcome an aggressive peacock, a mystifying hedge maze, and a patrol of Ulfen warriors in order to sneak into the ballroom and open the trapdoor under the pianoforte, where the third team is waiting.

#### Team Goods

- [[Princess Eutropia Stavian]], [[Rhenquist-Merosett]], and [[Tirri-Kastner]] emerge in the ballroom and begin their journey across the palace. Tirri struggles to connect with the others, but Rhenquist, recognizing the Princess’s love of the flowers throughout the Palace, connects with Eutropia by telling her about the history of the Hyacinth, which was named after her ancestor Hyacinth Erciyes. Eutropia picks a purple hyacinth and fixes it in Rhenquist’s pocket. 
- They overcome a deranged murderous portrait of an old woman and a pair of Ulfen guards before arriving triumphantly at the kitchen and bringing back a feast of desserts.

#### The Spoils of Victory

- The children enjoy the spoils of their victory and the pursuing very magical evening of fun, laughter, and friendship. The adult PCs reminisce on their memories of that evening. 
- Carrius shared a huge chocolate Knight of the Spellguard with Arturo and Prince Carrius, who started a small food fight with his sister.
- Zarissa embroiders little symbols on everyone’s pajamas.     
- Allister rushes to record his memories in a book, and Carrius shares a laugh with him over a cheeky poem making fun of Eutropia.     
- Rhenquist cherishes the hyacinth from Eutropia.     
- Arturo puts down his fork and knife and lets his hair down, eating with his fingers like the other kids.    
- Tirri cherishes small moments with all of the other children, including telling Rhenquist that she did, in fact, know how to waltz. Also, there is a hair braiding chain, in which everyone with long hair gets their hair (or beard, in Herog’s case) braided 
- The party comes to an end when a nanny discovers them and shoos them all off to their bedrooms.

#### Tirri has a Dream

That night, [[Tirri-Kastner]] has a dream of herself sleeping on a raised wooden platform in the wood. Three giant raven heads on thick serpentine necks stare and drool over her sleeping figure. They note that she has already been claimed, and when they notice Tirri watching from the wood, they bear down on her until she wakes up, soaking wet with sweat, just in time to hear a swishing cloak and the clicking of her bedroom door shutting.
