### Naked and Afraid

---

#### High Tea and Low Blows
The circadian rhythm of the inhabitants of the Palace of Birdsong begins to warp as the Grand Prince’s exhausting schedule takes its toll. Balls, parties, elaborate dinners with entertainment from Shelynite musicians and dancers and Fravian troupes, jousting tournaments (in which Rhenquist’s cousin Cypristian wins much acclaim) and trucco games in the gardens. While the children are barred from most of these events, not having made their society debuts yet, they still feel their schedule conforming to the ambitious push of the adults.

Outside the palace, the days grow longer, hotter, and drier, as the Summer Without Rain takes its own toll on the world. Despite the drought, the grounds of the Palace of Birdsong remain bright and colorful, the gardens well-tended to and thriving; and the evergreen trees of the Brashen Deeps - the vast wooded territory behind the Palace in which the Grand Prince hosts his hunts - flourish despite the brutal summer.
  
Allister Hound asks the Duchess Clement to take him shopping for a cane of his own, and the Duchess gratefully seizes the opportunity to get away from the bustle of the Palace. The Duchess struggles to change Allister’s personal narrative that she “bought him”.

Duchess Clement and Allister take a trip to the well-manicured city of Lotheedar. Their first stop is the atelier, where Allister is measured for a new wardrobe and consulted for his preferences. With a critically successful Lore (Fashion) check, Allister secures a fine new set of clothing in the sunset colors of House Clement, complete with a cane, though he makes sure to incorporate the colors of Andoran in small accessories.

After their shopping trip, Duchess Clement takes Allister to a tearoom where they share high tea and gossip voraciously, she about the other adults, he about the kids. 

> “You know the little boy Caritas?” “Young Zespire?”  “Mmmhmm. Well, let’s just say I think sword crossing runs in the family.”  “Indeed?”  _Duchess Clement and her new ward raised their teacups to their mouth and sipped in perfect unison._

The children are informed that they will take dancing lessons each morning in the ballroom under the tutelage of Madame Palponia, a Shelynite dancing instructor and a merciless taskmaster on the dance floor.

A wild race ensues to choose first partners. Rhenquist quickly asks Tirri, to be his partner, to Princess Eutropia’s well-masked disappointment. Carrius asks Allister, who accepts but whose refusal to speak to the Prince in terms of friendly familiarity leaves the prince deflated. Arturo is the odd man out and the last without a partner, so he is forced to dance with Madame Palponia.
 
Tirri distinguishes herself on the dance floor, earning Madame Palponia’s praise and a reputation for performance that spreads quickly throughout the palace.

### Mud, Blood, and Basilisk Ball

Rhenquist approaches Arturo, who is reading against a tree, to talk Basilisk Ball. Arturo proves to be a difficult student when it comes to the actual practice of the sport, and Rhenquist engages in several aborted attempts to find a good position on the team for Arturo as Bartleby, Fendren, and Caldadis heckle them. 

> “Make him the goaltender!” Bartleby sneered. “He’s so fat he’ll take up the entire scoring zone all by himself.”|

> “Here, catch!” Rhenquist tossed the ball gently to Arturo, who only barely managed to scream and dodge out of the way, leaving himself winded from the effort. “Okay, so…athletics. Not your thing. Got it.”

Eventually, Rhenquist realizes that Arturo is ill-suited for the more physically aggressive aspects of the sport, and alights upon the position of Watcher. He explains to Arturo that a Watcher is a team’s referee, and their job is to know all the rules and to watch to make sure the other team doesn’t break them. Arturo pledges to learn the rulebook by heart. !

When he isn’t studying the rules of Basilisk Ball, Arturo finds himself enchanted with the Sapphire Butterfly pamphlet he borrowed from Allister. It’s very different from the stuffy adult books at his house, and for the first time he lets himself feel like a kid. 

But he still takes studious notes about the pamphlet. 

Uncle Gregario comes in nursing a hangover and promises that he’ll make sure they get more Sapphire Butterfly pamphlets when they return home.

### The Prince

Grand Prince Stavian has garnered a reputation for drinking, carousing, and general rakishness, and the children even hear rumors that he frequently arranges for Calistrians (prostitutes) to visit the palace. On the rare occasion the Grand Prince does visit the kids, he’s energetic and friendly, and loves telling them stories of history and legend. Some of the stories he tells the children include:

Geb, the wizard king whose rivalry against his former friend was so powerful he returned as a ghost and rules over his kingdom of the dead.
    
The ancient Azlanti sorcerer Xin, who taught the secrets of magic to his seven rune lords only to be betrayed by them, as he always feared he would be. 
    
General Arnisant, the Glorian general who led the shining crusade to keep the Whispering Tyrant as Prophetic License had left him - dead.
    
Frutumalcaryn, the evil dragon who claimed the entire Inner Sea as his territory and who flew around proudly with the legendary sword Joyous plunged into his head in a show of victory against the brave lord protector of Rysher, who failed to slay him in the end.

### A Most Improper Adventure
  
One evening, Rhenquist takes a bath and emerges to find his clothes have all been stolen from his room. He finds a note from Martella Lotheed that she saw the boys steal his clothes and take them into the Brashen Deep, and that she’s following them. 

Rhenquist calls for help for the servants, but no one responds, presumably because they are occupied with the dinner party in the Palace. He waits as long as he can, then ventures out into the hallway in his bath towel just as Princess Eutropia turns the corner.

Eutropia covers her eyes and turns away, shouting out apologies that go unheard, because Rhenquist immediately ran back into his room and jumped out the window!

![[child_adventure_rhenquist_climbing.png]]
  
Dangling outside of Arturo’s window, Rhenquist calls for help. Arturo slowly marks his place in his book, opens the window to let Rhenquist in, and gives him a pair of pants.

Tirri hears the commotion from next door, and Allister watches the entire scene unfold from his balcony, so they both join Arturo and Rhenquist in Arturo’s room and agree to go with Rhenquist to retrieve his clothes. 

In the Brashen Deep, the children engage in the arduous process of collecting his clothes, which have been deliberately left in the most undesirable places - high in tree branches, tossed into mud puddles, and scattered over piles of droppings. 

  
![[scared_with_berries.png]]

The children hide in the shadows when they hear a conversation between two people. [[Ser Gul Guisarne]], Count Lotheed’s seneschal, is reprimanding a terrified halfling man for trying to steal berries from the Grand Prince’s hunting grounds. The man tearfully explains that his crops have not yielded because of the drought, and all the clean water has been rerouted to [[The Palace of Birdsong]] for their landscaping. Nevertheless, Ser Guisarne informs him that stealing from the Grand Prince is a crime against the crown, and that the punishment for theft is death. He aims his crossbow at the man and asks if he has any last words. 

[[Allister Hound]] makes a desperate attempt to distract Ser Gul Guisarne by throwing a stone. The distraction gives the halfling man a chance to escape, and he darts into the woods. [[Rhenquist-Merosett]] and [[Arturo Basri]] successfully hide from the senescal, but [[Allister Hound]] and [[Tirri-Kastner]] are caught, and Ser Guisarne tells them that their parents will be made aware of their obstruction of justice. !

As the children finish gathering Rhenquist’s clothes a disagreement breaks out between Rhenquist and Allister over Allister’s interference.

### Why did it have to be rats
The argument is interrupted by the approach of a pack of Giant Rats, which launch into an attack.


![[three_rats.png]]

The children fight to survive against the rats. Tirri proves herself a fair shot with her toy crossbow, and with Allister’s assistance aiming she manages to deadeye two of the giant rats, though not before she and Allister both sustained grievous injuries from the rats’ bites.

  
Arturo is armed with a small pile of hardcover books bound with a leather belt, and he swings it around in wild terror, accidentally hitting the last rat and breaking its jaw. 

  
Allister runs into the fray to try to help, and sustains another bite. This time, Allister falls unconscious and begins dying.

  
Rhenquist stabs at the last rat with the letter opener he borrowed from Arturo, eventually striking true to end the creature. 

  
Panicked and with no healing kit, Rhenquist and Arturo huddle around a dying Allister, trying their best to stanch the flow of blood and frantically trying to save their friend. 

  
![[tirri_i_think.png]]

Tirri stands frozen, but in the quiet distance she can hear the ringing of the Song of Stars for the first time. As Allister slips away, she feels a surge of cold starlight begin to siphon down from the skies above, as if she is a conduit, and a river of sparkling starlight flows from Tirri where she stands to Allister. 

Allister returns to consciousness as Tirri casts her very first healing spell. 

Rhenquist asserts that they need to find an adult, and they head back out of the Brashen Deep. All of the children except Allister begin to shiver and feel flush, and Tirri throws up. The three of them have all contracted filth fever from the bites of the Giant Rats.

Back at the Palace of Birdsong, a ball is in full swing in the ballroom, but the festivities come to a screeching halt as the four young scions, covered in mud and blood and sick, burst into the ballroom.
