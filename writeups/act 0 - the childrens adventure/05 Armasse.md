### Armasse
The Palace of Birdsong

---

  
With the end of summer comes Armasse, a celebration of Thaeodaen, Light of the Sword, the god of Angels and Knights. Armasse is a time to celebrate knights and squires, and a week of martial-focused events take place in Lotheedar and at the palace. Squires are knighted, and their squires are chosen. Various competitive events take place throughout, all culminating in the Grand Ball of Armasse at the end of the week.

-The children get up to their own antics. Arturo engages visiting knights by pressing them for their knowledge about Thaeodaen and their experiences with Armasse celebrations across the world. Tirri submits an embroidery piece for a competition, winning praise and encouragement from the judges if not an actual award. Allister seeks to ingratiate himself to the noble women of the Palace of Birdsong, taking opportunities to snipe at Lady Kastner and her remarks about his Chelish heritage. Zarissa enjoys the treats being handed out in the town, and finds a gown and an invitation to the Grand Ball waiting for her in her room, courtesy of the princess. Rhenquist tries to ingratiate himself to the Grand Prince, but finds the ruler preoccupied with his own entertainment during Armasse week. 

  

-Caritas distinguishes himself in the dueling arena against the other children before finally facing off against Eutropia in the finals. Though he loses to the princess, who incorporates flashy maneuvers drawn from the Stellarza dance they’ve been learning, she declares him a valiant and worthy opponent.

-At the Armasse Feast, the children enjoy eleven courses, each symbolizing one of the Eleven Acts of Thaeodaen, including a course of Ligosi Red wine, which Allister greatly relishes. After the feast, the Grand Ball begins

  

-The PCs show up in their finery. Rhenquist wears pauldrons studded with jade; Allister a dark blue and orange coat that shines like armor, and an Andoran blue bow tie; Tirri an elegant blue dress with a string of pearls; Arturo a gaudy and colorful matador-esque outfit that matches his uncle’s; Caritas an imitation of his father’s military formals with a burgundy coat; and Zarissa the silver and white gown from Eutropia.

-After the Grand Ball begins, Madame Palponia gathers the children together to prepare to go onstage. Arturo solemnly informs her that they cannot be together, and Tirri comforts and consoles Verlin Merosett, who is suffering from butterflies. Zarissa agrees to be Martella’s dance partner.

-Allister posts on the balcony with the Duchess and surveys the ballroom floor. He notices the Grand Prince and Lansieur Commandant Pythareus exchange looks, seemingly over Martella and Zarissa, and he also notices Ser Gul Guisarne glaring at Milon Jeroth, who is staring inappropriately at the children. The Duchess sighs over the sight of scions of the empire dancing alongside bastards and devils and wishes her husband could see. Allister asks about Milon Jeroth, and the Duchess says no one knows where he came from - “He just showed up one day, stitched himself to the Lansieur Commandant’s side, and has been there ever since.” 

  

 -The orchestra begins to play the Stellarza, and after a few measures the lights go out and the magic of the dance takes hold, sending up showers of sparks that float up to the ceiling where their feet strike and drag the floor.

-Carrius thanks Caritas for being kind to him this summer, and beams when Caritas calls him his friend. Zarissa struggles at first, but falls into step with Martella’s help. Tirri and Arturo bicker and obsess over making sure they don’t mess up the choreography. Eutropia tells Rhenquist she’s sad they won’t be spending time together in Rosanna, and they talk about their shared experience of being the spares. 

  

-After the dance, Eutropia asks the PCs to come with her to the garden, where she has a surprise for them. As they approach the courtyard, they smell cigar smoke, and then round on Bartleby, Fendren, and Caldadis throwing rocks at an injured and scared Martella. Eutropia headbutts Fendren, breaking his nose, and a fight breaks out among the children. Fendren shoves Eutropia into the fountain. 

  

-Zarissa rushes to comfort and protect Martella. Caritas jumps on Fendren’s back, earning an elbow to the stomach and a bump to the back of the head as Fendren smashes him against the garden wall. Arturo punches a twin in the groin, Allister takes a fist to the face, and Rhenquist helps Eutropia battle Caldadis at the Fountain as Bartleby projects magic attacks with his wand. 

  

-In the middle of the melee, Prince Carrius arrives, and an accident results in the prince sustaining a head injury. The Prince is rushed back to the Palace for medical attention, and the brawl comes to an abrupt halt. 

---

  

-The children are waiting in the parlor as the adults around them viciously fight, nearly coming to blows, over whose child is responsible for the Prince’s injury. The fighting ceases as the Grand Prince enters and demands the children explain what happened in the fight that injured his son, then sends Eutropia away in tears after blaming her for failing to protect her brother. 

  

-The first verbal duel takes place, as the children stumble over themselves to defend their position. Allister - and the other witnesses - are surprised when an inflection of unintentional magic flutters through his words, causing an outsized effect in the argument. At last, the Grand Prince announces that he has made his decision, and that he believes the fault lies with Bartleby, Fendren, and Caldadis. He leaves Count Lotheed to discipline his son. Everyone can hear the violent discipline the Count doles out as they leave the parlor.

|“Next time,” the Grand Prince said gravely, “no children.”|

  

-Carrius visits the children in the night, asking them to come out to the garden so Eutropia can give them her surprise. A tearful Eutropia joins them and hands out the flower crowns she made for them to remember the summer by. They all promise to keep in touch, and the night - and their summer together - comes to an end.

-As she walks back, Zarissa sees a person in her mother’s cloak walk into the Brashen Deep, leaving a trail of wilted flowers in her wake. She follows, and encounters not her mother but a strange woman in her mother’s cloak. The woman says she has been waiting to meet Zarissa, that she is a friend of her mothers, and that they have much to discuss. 

  

-The next morning, everyone leaves the Palace of Birdsong and returns to their respective homes. 

  

-Caritas leaves his heirloom dagger to Martella, along with a note promising a better world.

|These nine people - Rhenquist Merosett, Allister Hound, Arturo Basri, Tirri Kastner, Caritas Zespire, Zarissa Nocturne, Martella Lotheed, and Eutropia and Carrius Stavian will never be in the same city again for the next twenty years, save on one occasion, six years after the Summer Without Rain, when nobles and commoners from across the empire and far beyond make pilgrimage to the Gilded City of Rosanna for the sad business of attending the funeral procession of Prince Carrius Stavian, dead at sixteen years old, the result of a tragic accident that will plunge the Empire into an era of uncertainty and will usher in the War for the Crown.|
