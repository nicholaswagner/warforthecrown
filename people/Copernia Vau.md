### Copurnia Vau
the Head Curator of the Arcade of Triumphs

Copernia confirms that the crossbow is a counterfeit of Dignity’s Barb, and gives them some history of the relic. It was wielded by General Gerefein of the Seventh Army of Exploration, and its most famous moment was when he used it to shoot a Kellid warlord through a raging blizzard, finding his mark and winning the day. The relic was probably put in storage in one of the many corridors and passageways underground, never to be found again.
