### Weaknesses
- a person with an insatiable thirst for arcane knowledge.  he's constantly locked in his study learning more about arcane magic.  Much higher INT than you would expect.  He's kind of a slacker
- 5gp of arcane knowledge = +5 bonus to arcane checks against him forever

### Current mood toward the party:  `Helpful`

Can be influenced via Arcana but its really high... 25 worked for Arturo

Lore Fashion is one of his influence skills

25 on diplomacy "won't do it"
