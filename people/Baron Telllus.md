The baron over [[Moost]] where [[Dame Parthena Crabbe]] resides.  He has been a recluse for over 10 years.    (in Jambus).  No one has been admitted to his estate in this time.

The butler (Master Fratter Mosley) will great folks at the gate, but does not let them in.

The taxes continue to flow and so [[Count Bartleby Lotheed]] doesn't care.
