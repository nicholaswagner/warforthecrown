#### First Meeting
Allister is posted by the bar when he’s approached by a handsome Aiuvaran man who introduces himself as [[Lucien Alcier]]. Lucien and Allister flirt aggressively - Lucien identifies himself as the adopted son of the Ambassador from Kyonin, and the idle rich. 

He asks Allister to “help find his dance card” in the cloakroom, and they make their way there, emerging quite some time later having not found his coat.
