# From the Desk of Marquess Tanasha Starborne, Senator from Wispil

_Envoy to the Wildwood Lodge, Keeper of Too Many Papers and Not Enough Patience_

*To Lord Arturo Basri, Esteemed Investigator and Unflappable Correspondent in Trying Times*

> My dear Lord Basri,
> 
Oh, how *very* welcome your letter was\! You cannot imagine what a delight it is to receive something that isn’t either (a) a demand for a vote of confidence, (b) a demand for a vote of *no* confidence, (c) a panicked report about the Exaltation Massacre, or (d) a memorandum beginning with the words “urgent matter, please respond immediately.” I’ve had *quite enough* of all four, thank you!
> 
The Senate, as you can imagine, is in a *state.* I don’t mean a political state, I mean a *messy*, *chaotic*, *where’s-my-inkpot* kind of state. Half the Senators are barricaded in their estates, the other half are pretending nothing’s wrong, and the pages are all whispering about ghosts in the rotunda (and honestly, given the draft in there, I wouldn’t be surprised). Oh, and the pigeons have all gone missing again \- *again\!* \- which is why I was so very pleased to see a courier at my door bearing your seal.
> 
Now, you asked about Anllel Oakleaf, and I nearly spilled my tea when I saw her name. Goodness, what a relic of memory\! She’s one of the Archdruids of the Wildwood Lodge, as you rightly know. One of their senior-most, in fact, and not at all the sort of person to be trifled with. Cold as a frostfall morning, but precise, deliberate, and *impossible* to deceive. The first time we met, I remember thinking she could see straight through me, and not in a friendly “let’s have tea and talk about it” sort of way, but in the “I know every lie you’ve ever told” sort of way.
> 
Still, once you learn not to mistake her silence for disinterest, she’s a formidable ally. I’ve always had a good working relationship with her, which is no small feat considering her opinion of most of us in Glorian is that we’re “a nation of axemen trying to write treaties on bark we stole.” She never quite forgave the empire for the deforestation that followed the old Wildwood Treaty. Remember when I said she was one of the senior-most druids at the Wildwood Lodge? Well I really meant that. I think she was *actually alive* when the Wildwood Treaty was signed back in 3841\. And she carries the memory of the treaty (and the Verdigris Expanse as it was back then) like it was yesterday. That’s the thing about druids of her age: they don’t just remember history, they inherit it.
> 
When I last saw her…oh, let me think…it must have been early this year, before the whole business with the Exaltation Massacre turned everything upside down. She was... different. Slower. I had the impression she was preparing for something. Putting her affairs in order, as one might say, before a long journey. She spoke of “returning to the roots” and “settling the wild places within.” I thought she meant retirement, or perhaps, well, passing on. The Lodge was certainly treating her that way: reverent, protective, already speaking of her in the past tense when she was still standing right there.
> 
So to hear she’s been arrested for trespassing and witchcraft, of all things\! I confess, I nearly dropped my quill. Trespassing, perhaps I could believe; she’s never respected borders when nature was involved. But witchcraft? Ha\! If she wanted to hex someone, the forest itself would rise to do it for her.
> 
You must understand, Anllel is not one for dramatics. She’s quiet, watchful, and utterly efficient. The sort of person who can end a debate with a single word, or end a threat with a single gesture. I’ve seen her stare down a full conclave of druids over the placement of a single sapling. (I know that sounds small, but the sapling in question later grew into a sacred grove, so she was *right*, naturally.) There’s something about her that commands obedience. No shouting, no spells, just that calm certainty that she *is* the forest, and it’s foolish to argue with the trees.
> 
She once told me, very dryly, “Senator, you misunderstand us. The Wildwood does not wish for peace; it wishes for *balance*. Peace is merely what mortals call it when they are on the winning side of imbalance.” I wrote it down at the time. It struck me as the sort of line philosophers will someday argue about for centuries. I don’t remember where I wrote it down though, so let’s hope that philosophers stumble across that someday. Or, I guess now they could stumble across this letter.
> 
Now, to answer the more practical part of your inquiry: I haven’t had a proper dispatch from the Lodge since the Exaltation. Everything’s gone so sideways here in Rosanna that I haven’t dared send one of my usual messengers through the Verdigris Expanse. The last report I received \- carried, incidentally, by a very chatty starling who refused to leave until I shared my pastry \- suggested that the Lodge is mustering its forces. They’re gathering supplies, summoning allies from the deep woods, and strengthening the outer circles. The implication was clear: they’re preparing for war, or at least for *defense.* Maybe they’re worried the civil strife here might spill over into the Verdigris, and I don’t blame them. When humans fight, the forests always bleed.
> 
The gnomes of Wispil, bless their bright hearts, are already feeling the pressure. Fey from the inner glades have been growing restless, quarrelsome, even. Some blame the Senate’s chaos for disrupting the balance of things. (As if the fey needed an excuse to be temperamental\!) I’ve been trying to keep trade flowing, but every day brings a new complication. Just yesterday, a dryad delegation refused to cross the border until I personally apologized on behalf of “all civilization.” Which I *did*, of course, though it took three hours and two glasses of blackberry cordial.
> 
So you see, my dear Lord Basri, I fear you’ve stepped into something quite tangled. If Anllel was traveling this far from home, it wasn’t idle wandering. She must have had purpose \- a mission, perhaps, or a warning to deliver. And if she’s truly been detained, I’d advise handling her with utmost care. She’s not vindictive, but she *is* the sort of woman who wins every argument, one way or another. And if the Lodge ever finds out that she was mistreated…well, let’s just hope the Lodge never finds out anything like that. 
> 
I’ll do what I can to reach out to the Lodge through less official channels \- perhaps through the riverwardens or the rangers near Wispil \- but it may take some time. Things are... delicate here. (Oh, and if you happen to encounter any of the Senate Guard, *do* tell them to stop requisitioning my courier birds for “emergency communiqués.” I’ve gone through *four dozen* in a week\!)
> 
Until we next correspond, preferably under less apocalyptic circumstances, please take care, and do let me know what becomes of poor Anllel. If anyone can untangle this mystery, it’s you. 
> 
With affection, admiration, and far too many exclamation points,
> 
**Marquess Tanasha Starborne**  
Senator from Wispil  
Envoy to the Wildwood Lodge  
Ambassador (Unofficial) to Birds, Trees, and All Who Speak Wisely and Slowly
> 
*Postscript\!* I’m sending this with a squirrel courier. Don’t laugh\! He’s very reliable, though easily distracted by shiny things. If your reply arrives nibbled, please assume it was a show of enthusiastic agreement.
