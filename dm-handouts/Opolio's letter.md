The words may not have flown yet from your lips, but I know they are there, trembling like a sparrow waiting to fly. You will tell your mother what happened last night - not as it truly was, but dressed up and colored to make you a saint and me a monster. You will rush to her as you always do, with your wide eyes and your trembling hands, and she will hold you and believe every word you choose to say. You will slander my name and my reputation to the most insatiable gossip in the empire. And with each breath you take, my name, my future, my very life will be unmade.
>
Last night was not the crime I know you will twist it to be. It was you who led me on, who smiled and lingered, who gave me every signal a man could mistake for welcome. You know this, and yet you mean to play the innocent, to say I “attacked” you as though you were some lamb and I a wolf. If there is guilt, it is shared, yet it is I alone who will wear the iron collar of shame when you open your mouth.
>
Do you understand what you are about to do? Every word you plan to speak is a stone in my pockets, every glance of your mother’s scorn another inch deeper into the mire. You will go on, protected and adored, while I am cast out, mocked, and branded. That is the future you are building even now.
>
I cannot and will not live through the slow hanging you are preparing for me. Before this week is ended, I will go to the bog and let the water take me. At least there, in the reeds and the dark, I will find the silence of death - a silence you would deny me.
>
When you lie awake tonight, as I know you will, remember: it will not be despair that drowns me, but you. You and the story you choose to tell. Though I vanish beneath the water, it will be your lies that drags me under, your betrayal that fills my lungs. You have ended my life with your words last night. The least you can do now is spare my legacy with your silence.

Forever,
