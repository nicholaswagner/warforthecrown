### The Confessions of Marjorine Sandaris

I, Marjorine, once Knight of Glorian and Baroness of proud House Sandaris, do set mine hand to this woeful chronicle.

In days long fled, a warrior was I of the Shining Crusade, serving beneath the noble banner of Sir Omri Shevath. Yet grievous was the wound I took in the storming of the bloody shore of Von Till, where also fell my brother, my heart’s own twin in arms. Broken in flesh and spirit, I sought return unto my father’s hall in Glorian—but Death, that silent usurper, claimed me ere I might arrive.

Yet mine end was not an end. My breath was stilled, yet my soul lay fettered within a carcass that did rot and reek. I heard all, yet stirred not, imprisoned in decay. On the eve of my funeral, foul horror did o’ertake me: I rose, a famished wretch, with hunger sharp as razors for the flesh of mine own kin. Three I did slay—Osseen, Doreen, and gentle Marjan—ere Lysander, priest and cousin, shone the burning light of Aroden upon me, and smote my visage into ash.

Yet Death, faithless jailor, would not grant me rest.

That Whispering Monster’s baleful fever, seed of his accursèd might, rekindled me beneath the dark of moon, when Elodin veiled her silver face. From tomb unsealed I burst, and once more laid waste to blood of mine own blood, till axe and fire did rend my body to ruin. But still, when next the new moon’s shadow fell, again I rose, a pestilence upon my house. Thrice did Lysander bind me, casting sacred wards and laying me to rest with Godspike, my holy spear. At last was I entombed, soul bound in tortured sleep, a hollow peace bought by holy chains.

But Time, relentless scythe, doth mow e’en stones to dust.

Waters flooding, cruel and heedless, gnawed my bindings, and I awoke once more, a carrion shade upon the haunted moors. My hall lay shattered, kin all scattered; yet still upon the wind I tasted faint the blood of Sandaris, spread through Stachys like a thinning wine, weak in strength yet rich in multitude. With waning will I seized the shreds of mine own humanity, fleeing exile-ward, that I might plague no innocent save those fools that trespass this forsaken ground. Yet ceaseless is the strife betwixt my soul and the unholy hunger that doth govern this wretched form.

When first I clawed forth from the warded crypt, lo—my hand found Godspike once again. Still do I clutch it, though its hallowed fire doth scorch my flesh and drain my marrow, hoping ever that its sanctity may undo the curse. Yet come the new moon’s birth, my sinew waxeth strong, and no holy spear, though blessed of the Red Crusader’s priests, may grant me blessed oblivion.

The ravening lust of flesh is master o’er my will. When meat is nigh, resolve turneth dust, and I become the beast I most abhor. Those that dare assault me, if fortune spare their flight, return anon when fever’s fang hath claimed them, bound to me in hunger’s covenant. To such I whisper the dread litanies of the Red Crusader, and together we do linger in loathing and endless famine. O for true death, to break these bonds, and slip this tyrant’s curse! Yet still his grasp is strong, and I, though far from his dark realm, remain enthralled.

Thus in blood I spill my sorrow, a testament and a plea, in search of understanding though not redemption. Let any who read these lines know the torment of Marjorine Sandaris: warrior once, monster now, ever soul in anguish. Take warning from my tale, and grant mercy unto those poor shades who suffer such a doom.
