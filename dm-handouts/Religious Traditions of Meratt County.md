### On the Religious Traditions of Meratt County

The religious landscape of Meratt County is at once emblematic of Glorian’s greater spiritual fabric and marked by peculiarities that set it apart. As in most of the empire, the foundational pillars of faith have long been Abadar and Shelyn, the divine patrons of civic life and cultural aspiration. The God of Walls and Ditches has historically enjoyed strong devotion in the county’s prosperous settlements. His worship has waned somewhat in those towns that have declined or contracted over the centuries, yet his altars remain well attended in the cities such as Lotheedar and Pensaris. The Cathedral of the Wealthy Father in Lotheedar stands as the principal seat of Abadaran worship in the county, where the city’s merchants, magistrates, and civic officials still gather in solemn reverence for the divine order that sustains law and wealth alike.

Shelyn, by contrast, has always found her followers among those who cherish beauty, music, and love. In Meratt’s provincial towns, her rites are often humble (a bridal hymn sung at a wedding, a painted icon kept in a family shrine) but in more cultivated places her presence is resplendent. Moost has become the foremost center of her worship, thanks in large part to the patronage of Dame Parthena Crabbe. Through her generosity, the Moost Conservatory has flourished as a seat of artistic study, while the adjoining Chapel of the Dawnpetal Lyre offers both students and townsfolk a place to venerate the Eternal Rose with song and prayer.

In the countryside, the face of devotion shifts, as is common throughout Glorian’s agrarian heartlands. The people of Meratt have long held Erastil, Old Deadeye, as their guide. His faith is not organized through grand temples or clerical hierarchies, but through the quiet strength of hearth and harvest. Village elders and seasoned hunters serve as the natural custodians of his wisdom, dispensing counsel that blends the practical with the sacred. His worship is expressed in rituals both modest and enduring: the offering of a hare’s heart at the season’s first hunt; the lighting of fires along the boundaries of fields before planting to invite Erastil’s blessing; and the telling of long, moralizing tales by the fireside, wherein each story is as much a prayer as it is instruction. These ceremonies bind families and neighbors in common cause, ensuring the god of the hunt remains woven into the daily rhythm of rural life.

Yet, for all these familiar devotions, Meratt’s deepest spiritual character is shaped by its origins in the Shining Crusade, that great and terrible struggle against the Whispering Tyrant in the 39th century AR. The memories of that war, its glories, its sacrifices, and its profound sorrows continue to echo in the county’s devotion to Thaeodaen, the Inheritor. As Aroden’s chosen herald and later the ascended god of valor and righteous war, he embodies the ideals of honor, courage, and sacrifice that the crusaders once held aloft as their standard. Churches dedicated to him dot Meratt’s towns and villages, and his holy days are marked with processions, knightly tourneys, and prayers that seek to keep his virtues alive in the hearts of the faithful.

Yet here lies one of Meratt’s peculiarities: alongside devotion to Thaeodaen, the county retains an unusual and enduring reverence for Arazni, the Red Crusader, who was Aroden’s herald before her fall. Though never a true goddess, Arazni was called to the mortal battlefield during the Shining Crusade when the Knights of Ozem, driven to desperation, summoned her to lead them. She had long served as their patron and exemplar, and though she was willing to fight freely, the Knights bound her will with mortal sorceries, fearing that without compulsion even a herald might falter before Tar-Baphon’s might. This act planted in her a seed of doubt and bitterness, though still she took up arms against the Tyrant. Her courage did not spare her from tragedy: in 3823 AR, she was struck down and humiliated by the lich, her body hurled broken before her faithful at the Battle of Three Sorrows.

The sorrow of her fall only deepened in the years that followed. After the Whispering Tyrant’s defeat in 3827 AR, the Knights of Ozem interred Arazni with great reverence in their new citadel in the city of Vigil. Yet her rest was short-lived. In 3890 AR, agents of the ghost-king Geb, seeking vengeance against the Knights of Ozem, assaulted Vigil  and carried Arazni’s body into their master’s grasp. Geb, with his perverse arts, dragged her soul back from the Great Beyond, feeding upon the doubt sown by her knights and the despair of her death. Over years, he reshaped her into a lich bereft of her former glory and enthroned her as his Harlot Queen, the unwilling administrator of his grim dominion. Thus was Arazni not only slain by the Tyrant but condemned to a second, joyless existence under the hand of a new master.

It was in the wake of her fall that Thaeodaen, once her devoted paladin, rose to take her place as Aroden’s herald. Where Arazni’s tale is one of betrayal and corruption, Thaeodaen’s ascent offered a counterpoint of faith renewed. In Meratt, the two stories are told together, inseparably entwined. Many here regard Thaeodaen as the triumphant successor but honor Arazni as the martyred forerunner, the one whose suffering cleared the path for Thaeodaen’s glory. Notably, Meratt’s own Marjorine Sandaris, remembered both as a champion of the Shining Crusade and as one of the county’s great ancestral figures, declared herself a Champion of Arazni even after the Red Crusader’s fall. To this day, certain shrines in Meratt preserve her memory not merely as herald, but as saintly martyr, and prayers to Arazni (though never formally sanctioned by any great church) still find whispered voice among those who remember her sacrifice.

Other faiths play only passing roles in Meratt. Pharasma, for example, holds no special place in the county’s history beyond the universal invocation of her rites at funerals. Her priests are respected but not especially influential, called upon to fulfill their sacred duties when the cycle of life meets its inevitable end.

Meratt County’s religious tapestry is one of both tradition and tragedy. Abadar orders its cities, Shelyn inspires its beauty, Erastil guides its fields, and Thaeodaen leads its banners. Yet in the quiet spaces between, one finds remembrance for Arazni, the fallen herald whose story, bitter though it be, remains carved deep in the memory of a land shaped by crusade.
