The most prestigious institution of education in Zimar, the Gennaris Academy offers a wide range of subjects in its curriculum. Thanks to its well-meaning but old-fashioned and stubborn headmaster, Venarius Apillo, the academy offers a far more comprehensive selection of courses in history, law, and military science than any other subject. Critics in other countries, particularly in Cheliax and Qadira, maintain that the academy teaches a one-sided version of history and that its lies and half-truths about Glorian's rivals are not conducive to building trust and revitalizing trade.
