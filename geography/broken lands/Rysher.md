### Rysher

- Rysher is small nation in the Broken Lands.
- Vibe: _Arthurian Camelot meets Fairy Tales_
- Their people are proud and preternaturally optimistic, very likable / great people.
- Thaeodaen (God) is here
	- Basically the "Martial" God, lots of swords etc

- Where Glorian has 12 Prefectures, Rysher has 5 courts, each led by a knight
- The "King" is Jacques Coeurageaux who refuses the title of king and instead is the "Lord Protector".
	- backstory:  climbed a beanstalk and stole a drink from a golden cow, which ended up being a fountain of youth.  So he's like 900 years old.
	- truly a good guy, believes in the ideals of heroism and established Rysher in the River Kingdoms to create a place that lives up to his ideals of harmony and equality
	- each "court" holds a magical artifact. (merlin analogue has a magic mirror etc)
	- magic item in Ardenvale (JC lives) is a white flame circle called the circle of loyalty
	- the "knights of the roundtable" analogue is also called the Circle of Loyalty, as the final act of joining the order is that you walk through the CoL (fire) and come out on the other side.

  The **Stellarza** is a Rysherian dance which is a quick paced waltz with tango-like elements of footwork including lots of heel and toe dragging. Furthermore, the Stellarza is traditionally performed in the dark.  [[Vice Count Rene Malbec du Valle]] & [[Madeira Zespire]] demonstrated this dance to the child PC's during Armass week.  They did it blindfolded since the dance is meant to be performed in total darkness.
